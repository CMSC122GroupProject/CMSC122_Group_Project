the insertion of the photo at the bottom, which came from "fig caption"  documentation etc -->

            As students at the University of Chicago, we often found ourselves looking for the best place to eat dinner. We had multiple preferences and
            constraints that influenced our choice: time frame, desired quality, and budget. We realized that while google and yelp could provide us
            with information on all these search parameters, no efficient method existed for finding all restaurants that fit our search criteria.
            Hence, the Aster*sk Project was born. The original conceptualization-inputing restaurant criteria and returning restaurant results-is 
            implemented on the restaurants page of this site. To access it, click on the <strong> first link on the forms page </strong>.

            The Aster*sk Experience (PLANNER) is the newest extension of our original application. We wanted to answer the following question: given a block of time,
            what is the most efficient way to spend my time between movies and restaurant experiences in the general Hyde Park area. Using a proprietary
            Least-Cost Algorithm, we are able to acheive this goal. To access this extension, click on the <strong> second link on the forms page</strong>.
