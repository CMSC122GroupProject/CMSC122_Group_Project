The food was well seasoned and flavorful. However, on a slow night, our waitress was terrible. My food arrived cold. Mostly because our waitress was chillin'. \u00a0Pros: lentil soup! The food was fresh. Cons: bad waitress, waitress drowned my salad in a house oil/vinegar dressing w/o first asking if I wanted it, and she seemed a little spacey. I'd come back because the food was so f*cking good.", "I love Mediterranean food with how simple and wholesome the ingredients are, but Cedar's never manages to get it quite right. I've had their food a bunch of times as they cater to a lot of UChicago events. Although the spices are there, the texture of the chicken is always off -- it's always too rubbery, as if I were eating chicken-flavored plastic/gum.I went to the restaurant to see if the food was any better and unfortunately that was not the case. I ordered the Shekriya. It was too creamy and rich, and there was barely any lamb meat! Quite pricey for the lack of protein...While I won't say no to free Cedar's, you won't find me sitting down at their restaurant any time soon.", "Whatever had kept you from trying this place, has kept tourism a Hyde Park gem. I'm a sucker for their Salmon kebobs, so much so that I rarely order anything else. Although, over the years I've had crushes on their different entr\u00e9es, depending on my mood. The Kushary, Tagene, and Chicken Tika Tandoori are all excellent choices. With the depth of their menu, I can brings friends who have dietary restrictions, due to faith or personal choice. You have the option of double veggies or rice with most entr\u00e9es. They have well seasoned soups and warm pita is served along side your meal. I just wish they had a better drink selection but I'm anti-Pepsi products. I love that I can work out or be famished and get full from a place with healthier options that are so delicious! Most of their meats are grilled and I have even purchased Moroccan seasoning trying to get my food at home to taste like some of theirs. The have a simple and clean set-up and get packed in the evenings. They also deliver, which I opt for on cold nights. I've always had friendly and attentive servers, a calm ambiance that perks with lively diners, and a free parking lot shared by nearby businesses.", "I was here for a UChicago event, which means two things: (1) I wasn't paying and (2) I didn't pick the menu. I'm also not a Mediterranean expert, so even though I looked up their menu; I can't guarantee anything without a picture provided is correctly identified, retrospectivelyLocation: Kind of in a strip mall. Easy to find. Bit more upscale than the adjacent businesses.Pricing: Looking at their menu; it's a bit pricey, but portions are good, both for individual and family style. Probably better suited for family style.Food: Okay, let me attempt to list the various items. For appetizers, we had warm pita, falafel, Three Cheese Flatbread, Spicy Chicken Wings (not at all spicy) and I think the Chopped Salad. The entrees included Grilled Lamb Chops, Chicken Shawerma, Tagene, Ripe Tomato Cous Cous, and... I think that was it. Everything was well-seasoned, and the meat was juicy. There are not a ton of vegetarian options, but you can find some stuff to make it work. This is also a BYOB kind of place if you want to spice up your evening.Service: Well-attended, but when you have a party of 40, I would try to keep them happy so they come back the next year. TLDR: I wouldn't say this is anything fantastic; I'm told it's usually empty, but I also don't have a good standard to hold up against this place.", "This is my absolutely favorite Mediterranean restaurant in Chicago. The food is delicious, and the portions are huge. I usually make two meals out of one order. There are many vegetarian and meat options, all affordably priced between $7 and $12. The atmosphere is pleasant and the restaurant is very clean with an open kitchen. The servers are extremely friendly. The management has also been very kind and helpful.", "Lunch portions are very huge and a great price ! \u00a0we got the lunch combo and it came with a delicious soup !! the lunch plate is so big !! The service is very friendly and fast . The food is good but be warned you might be sleepy afterwards ! lol", "Went to Cedar Mediterranean Kitchen, \u00a0it's in the Hyde Park neighborhood mixed in at a strip mall location. \u00a0The restaurant is super clean and nicely decorated. \u00a0The staff was helpful and present. The lentil soup was good after adding salt. Everything was good but a little under seasoned. Once you add salt and pepper everything is YUMMY. \u00a0I had the combo of chicken Tika and ribs, it was so tender and delicious. \u00a0It wasn't crowded when we arrived at 5pm on a Saturday. Enjoy its a good, solid restaurant.", "The reason that I'm giving five stars is the fact that the owner of the restaurant was so sweet in taking care of us and everyone around us. For a Saturday night this place was packed. The lentil soup on a cold snowy day was amazing. We had the veggie combo plate and the cedars kebab combo plate. Both were delicious. The veggie plate had hummus, stuffed grape leaves and falafel. My husband loved the falafel while I just loved the grape leaves. The meats were juicy and the variety was excellent . Dessert with their pineapple cheese hasasa was so good with tea. A great meal and most likely will come again since it's so close to home", "Recently ordered the chicken shawarma dinner platter with rice. It also came with a house salad and roasted veggies. Very delicious, and I didn't feel TOO bad about myself since there was a lot of vegetables. The raw red onions that the chicken was on was a bit too strong for me; I think they would have been better if they did a quick pickle on them to cut it a bit.", "I'd order it again! The chicken kabob was seasoned well and the portions of hummus and side vegetables were excellent. The chicken kabob may have been a little dry for some but I'm ok with drier meat.", "I love getting their saut\u00e9ed vegetables (cauliflower and eggplant appetizer, along with a large hummus with chicken and lamb. Yum!!!", "The Yelp reviews were what influenced my friend and I to stop here for a \"quick\" lunch on our way to the 57th Street Art Fair. \u00a0There was nothing quick about it, nor was there much of anything discernibly Middle Eastern about this restaurant, other than the name.Based on the reviews I started with the lentil soup. \u00a0Whoever says this soup is delicious is delusional. \u00a0It was ok enough, but more a consistency of water than soup, and there certainly wasn't much lentil to it. \u00a0My friend had tabuhle, which was a generous serving and tasted pretty fresh. \u00a0It also tasted like too much oil, way too much parsley and not enough bulgher. Then, something seemed to get lost in getting the lamb + beef/schwarma sandwich to me which I had ordered. Waited..the server finally stopped over to tell me it would be soon. \u00a0Waited. \u00a0It finally came. \u00a0I asked for tahini and hot sauce, I was brought tahini and salad dressing.The schwarma didn't have any discernible lamb taste, and some parts looked like chicken. \u00a0After a 30 minute wait, it was questionable as to what they had actually done to produce this sandwich. \u00a0Tasted more like fajitas than schwarma, maybe that was what the cook knew.I lived in the Middle East and my friend is from Lebanon. \u00a0She explained the name Cedars makes it a Lebanese restaurant. \u00a0Apparently, any Lebanese involved headed for the hills long ago, and they took their lamb with them.Apparently they lost their abacus as well. \u00a0When the server brought my change, she shorted it 45 cents!", "I am not sure what happened here. We noticed many small maintenance items being left undone around the seating area. Things like missing vents and light bulbs burned out. The food was o.k., not what I expected after the other wonderful visits. The server was overwhelmed with too many tables and no support from anyone else. Where was the manager or owner? I am giving the stars and hoping my experience was a one off.", "Lunch is fantastic value for a student budget, particularly with the UofC student discount (it's 10%). I got a chicken kebab, roasted veggies and rice, as well as pita and lentil soup for less than $8 with tax. You can switch out the rice for fries or other veggies and the soup for salad if you want.There were enough leftovers to provide dinner - in fact, the chef actually added some rice/vegetables to the box I was taking to go! Service was good, and I was able to get in and out in around 35-45 minutes.Will definitely be back to try the falafel sandwich and the spicy red lentil soup.", "I've been coming back to this place for a while now, and haven't updated my review. Since the last time, the food has gotten a lot better. It has a lot of flavour and the portions are good, especially during take out. I've tried the soups, chicken wings, Mediterranean chicken sandwich pita, chicken and beef/lamb sharwama, skirt steak, pomegranate ribs, and vegetable tangine. The Egyptian lentil soup is amazing, it's so delicious and so high in nutritional value. The spicy garlic chicken wings are so good, especially with the garlic sauce they provide. The sandwich pitas are tasty, and they come with a side salad, house dressing, and homemade fries only for $8.24. Sharwama's really good, while the skirt steak is good but a bit dry sometimes. And if you ever have to between the steak or short ribs, get the short ribs! The short ribs are superb, the pomegranate sauce is truly wonderful. The vegetable tangine is a must for any vegetarian, and cooked in beautiful refreshing sauce; the smell is just heavenly! The environment is super clean, and customer service is amazing. The staff are so friendly, efficient, and fast. They are very nice to all their customers. This is my favourite Mediterranean/Middle Eastern restaurant in Chicago. I eat here at least once a week so if you're in the neighbourhood then enjoy the food, and fabulous customer service. Also they offer 10% off to students so don't forget to bring your student ID.", "My favorite Middle Eastern place. All the food is exceptional and fresh, while the service is also wonderful. Anytime I take my parents to their doctors appointments, I make sure to get over there and get some hummus and shwarma. Their think is leaps and bounds better than other places. I honestly cannot wait to go back.", "As we entered into the almost empty restaurant, there was a sign that read PLEASE WAIT TO BE SEATED. We waited as several staff members walked back and forth cleaning tables that were already clean. Finally, after several minutes, a waiter said, \"Oh, you can have a seat wherever you'd like.\" The waiter took our order (see pics of food) and everything seemed fine until I noticed that the salad that I received was not what I ordered. The waiter was out of sight and never checked on us until the end of our meal. I ate what I wanted out of the salad and explained that this was not what I ordered. I wasn't charged for the salad. Mediocre service at best!!", "This was my second time at Cedars. After reading the online reviews, I decided to give it another try. I really wanted to like it. Unfortunately, the hummus just tasted like lemon, the pita was just ok and I was expecting yellow lentil soup. Guess I just have a different tastes so not for me.", "My gf (32) took me (29) here on a date one a Wednesday night. We both were nervous because we had never tried Mediterranean food. Parking was simple. Customer service great! The food was hearty, hot and delicious!

The hostess was rude, the other people in the restaurant were very loud, and the food was pretty average stuff. Never come here again.", "I can be a little annoying when I have my mind set on something, so I kept pestering my friend that I needed a burger. Lol...we bundled up and walked here. From the outside it looked a little fancy, but once inside the prices were reasonable and it was family friendly. Every Leona's seems to be different with the atmosphere. I ordered the blue moon burger which I didn't care for. Instead of regular blue cheese it was blue cheese salad dressing which made the sandwich sort of soggy and disgusting. Fries were steak potato style and were good. My friend said normally he orders the lasagna but this time he went with the chicken parm sandwich and said it was pretty good. Service was good, prices reasonable, food just okay.", "I'm surprised Leona's is still in business. The service was poor and food was bland and overpriced. I will never come back.", "This place has become ridiculous and the owner doesn't care about the customers or the servers. \u00a0I overheard him talking about how he doesn't care if we like the food or not, and a server was complaining about a missing check and again he stated that was not his problem .The food was cold and we asked the server to re-do the order but the owner insisted everything was just fine.", "I've been here three times and each time Leona's has met my expectation, which is good tasting (but unhealthy) Italian food served with average service. \u00a0I usually bring a book and get some reading done while waiting.The Long Islands are delicious, but on the sugary side (you've now been warned). \u00a0The lasagna, garlic bread, Avocado Burger, and Chipotle Chicken Pizza (order with extra chipotle sauce) are all solid picks. \u00a0Avoid the ravioli al-forno since it isn't a large order and the beef roast over penne since that was bland.While 10% more expensive than other dinner places in Hyde Park, the serving sizes are at least 10% larger so it works out in the end. \u00a0I might be giving this one star too many since there are some issues with service (as pointed out in many other Yelp reviews), but if you don't have high expectations it is easier for them to be met.", "I like this place a lot of come here many times to eat their pizza and they never disappoint. Their other options of food aren't bad either, and the service is good too.", "I've been a loyal Leona's customer for several years but ever since the new ownership took over, the quality has really deteriorated. There used to be a choice of 6-8 sides with a burger, then four (two of which were soups! who has soup with their burger?) and now you can only get fries (and they give you a small portion - but that's ok because they're not good) Other menu favorites, like the mac and cheese, have disappeared, as did the delicious leona's cakes that used to be complimentary. Every time I order over the phone the staffer can barely hear me (why not put the phone in a quiet place?) and lately the service has been rather poor. The new ownership has offered more deals (e.g. a student discount) but it has generally raised prices, so the deals don't matter. So disappointed how they're running this once-great restaurant into the ground. Listen to your customers and go back to the old ways!!!", "The veggie pizza was well made. I really enjoyed it and probably will go back for that. We also had the buffalo wings, which were good, huge, and hott. I would not get the garlic bread again. It was too greasy, did not have an authentic garlic flavor, and did not have fresh parmesan cheese. Service was great but the atmosphere was dull. The place was pretty much empty on a friday night.", "This place is a joke, right?Came here with family on a Friday night and the place was deserted. That should have been a clue right there, but hey we were hungry. Though we were quickly seated it took ten minutes to be actually acknowledged by our waitress. Grrreat start.I had the calamari which was a mistake because it had everything BUT fried squid in the dish (seriously? fried lemons and jalapenos? no thanks). When it came to my entree, I had the lasagna which was obviously pre-made. And the \"sausage\" had an unsual coloring and flavor...gross. My sis ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. Her meatballs were questionable in both taste and texture and the only thing she enjoyed was the bread. For the majority of our meal, our waitress was no where to be found which was crazy because of how empty the place was. It took over 20 minutes just to get a refill on water. Everything about this place was disappointing.", "This is my second time here, and I am not impressed with the service at all. Ok , I know I'm at Leonas and I don't expect a fabulous gourmet meal. Food is decent, but the waitress was awful. She didn't bring us any utensils to eat with even after our entrees got here. I ordered lasagna, how can I eat that with out a fork? I asked her for napkins like three times and she would not bring them. It was 1130 am and NO ONE was at the restaurant. I got up to grab napkins and utensils myself. The bus boy noticed and he brought it to the table .....he apologized for her. When the bill came, she wanted to charge me for an iced tea that tasted bad. I didn't drink the iced tea and asked for a replacement drink. Usually when something doesn't taste good, it's taken off the bill bc it wasn't consumed. When i brought it up to her she didn't say anything at all and just walked away from me. Wth??? I wasn't mean about it. Anyways. She's not going anywhere in life by being lazy.", "Leona's what have you done? The menu keeps changing and not for the better. The portions get smaller while the prices get higher. And the ultimate insult tonight...my favorite the 'Kick Ass Garlic Bread' needs to be kicked to the curb as it resembled neither garlic nor bread.

My friend got hot tea with no spoon to stir so she stirred it with a knife. He didn't even ask if we wanted anything else to drink or if we needed refills. His communication and enthusiasm was next to none. This is my 2nd time coming after the management and menu changed and still I'm unsatisfied with my experience.

I finished my food requested my bill and waited and waited and waited finally i left exact change on the table and left forty minutes after requesting the bill \u00a0the food was good but the lousy service kills any interest in returning. Better to order delivery from this place or other locations as it seems the dine in side is inept", "Since the new owner took over the food is subpar, and not as good as the old Leona's.

Overall this place was great a good place to eat. All it lacked was a wow factor.", "I came to this location because the reviews were favorable (compared to the others). This location is under new management (not sure when it occurred) and apparently there have been some changes to the menu. The service was extremely slow and it wasn't even crowded.

They should have had the delivery guy bring it or offer a free dessert or something... but they did nothing. They give two sides which is too much, but they were good enough. I wish they'd just give 1or 0 sides and just make real Fish & Chips, and not forget anything. Also, it doesn't even come with malt vinegar. Even Long John Silvers does it better, way better, sadly.

When we entered our server whose name was Brian greeted us shook our hands and was really friendly towards us it's as if he was greeting old friends here hadn't seen in a while. He seated us, gave us drink recommendations, as well as recommendations on the food. He was very quick in getting our orders in on time and just being an overall great example of customer service! For the food and drinks, we got pitchers of Sangria which were $10 that night so we got two and they were great, both the Strawberry Lemonade and the Pineapple Express. We then ordered or appetizers Calamari and Cheese quesidilla, which came out in no time! Good thing because we were starving. And then our entrees came right after. I ordered Mac and Cheese with Bacon and Jalape\u00f1o and loved it! I will come back for this again!

I liked the atmosphere. It was across from the beach and they had outdoor seating. We ordered at the bar and although the bartender was fast taking our order it took a while for our food to come out. The place wasn't packed either. The food however was good! My friend had the Roasted Vegetable Flat Bread and I really liked \u00a0the how crispy the flat bread was. I had the Bar Louie Burger. You can't go wrong with hot sauce and blue cheese on a burger. The fries that came with it on the side were also pretty tasty and seasoned well. I didn't have a cocktail this time, but from other Bar Louie's I've been to the cocktails are pretty good...almost dessert like. I plan on stopping by here again the next time I'm at the beach. Perfect location and great way to refuel after a lazy summer day at the beach.", "They've got a pretty good drink selection and their martinis are great! I would recommend only coming to this bar for the drinks, though, because the food is not all that great.

I for sure will NEVER eat here again unless the management changes.", "You guys. I am probably one of the most laid back diners you'll find, but this place is the absolute worst bar/restaurant I've ever been to. I was SO DISAPPOINTED because there are very few places in Hyde Park to go for drinks and food, and I thought c'mon, how bad could it be? Bad. It was bad.We went here for the Duke game in March. It wasn't the championship- probably the 2nd round or so. We went around 5p on a Friday. They were relatively busy but we were able to get seated right away. It went downhill from there. We asked the server if she would ask to get the TV changed. I shit you not (we timed it), it took over an hour. Alright, fine. We'll improvise.... let's watch on the phone. Then we each ordered a drink, and they were 10 bucks a piece. Alright, fine. I would have liked to see a price on the menu, but it's not a big deal. We ordered the bruschetta, and it came out just before our drinks. About 20 minutes for both. We ate it quickly and noticed that the people in the booth behind us finished their meal and left. Then, for the rest of the time we were there, the tables were not cleared. There were at least 3 tables just covered with napkins and what not. What the hell? We ordered a quesadilla (I don't know why. Moment of weakness, and I was freaking hungry) and it took 45 or so minutes to come out. OMG. By then we were pissed, still hungry, not watching the game, and just ready to go home. We could barely flag the waitress down (but don't worry, I saw her getting her smoke break!) and just paid and bolted. I blame the managers. The servers were slow, but I'm pretty sure they were the bus boys, servers, food runners.... shit. They may have been cooking the food too for all I know.All in all, DON'T go here. Just don't. Trust me. Just stay home, you'll have a better time.", "Let me start off by saying I think Three Stars is being very generous. I read a lot of reviews before heading here and was seriously hoping it wasn't the case. But the stories of the incapable wait staff. Slow service and overpriced apps and drinks are very true. Our waiter didn't write down any of our orders and got them wrong a couple times. It took forever for him to bring simple things like water, extra silverware ect. And the happy hour price exclusions kinda irritated me assuming that's why I went there. \u00a0I don't believe I'll be returning to this particular location but I will try the downtown or Oak Park locations.", "The new management of this place has destroyed the origional approach to they had to its clientele. It used to be your friendly Hyde park neighborhood bar with a comfy feel. Now it's the weekend turn up on a tuesaday...and I'm not even refferencing the music. I went on a date to this place and was making an attempt to spark up some nostalgia for an hour or two. But that idea was halted. The new staff members are very abrasive. We were done with our dinner and was told at the last minute that we couldn't pay with a card because the machine was down. No one said anything before hand. So I asked to speak with a manager because I didn't want to use the atm and rack up even more charges (on top of the expensive bill). He made us wait for a good 20 minutes so I got impatient. I was unable to hide my annoyance because we didn't have long before the parking meter garnered us a ticket. The \"bouncers \" began surrounding the front door on some \"YOU SHALL NOT PASS\" type of thing and appeared to be there for us. I guess we were technically being held at ransom and I had to find out what the price was. Finally we got our napkin (appearantly a.k.a receipt) and it was almost half off. But the cost was that I had to use their atm. Needless to say we ended up getting our $75.00 ticked from the beautiful people over at the Chicago police department. We were ten minutes late after the whole \"ransom\" situation but I guess that would only end up sounding like a tired excuse to any patrol officer..I couldn't even believe it myself. So ...can't say the new management has done enough to make me feel confident about going back. Get it together guys.", "Ambiance and decor were true to the Bar Louie brand. \u00a0Disappointing was the service (inattentive and slow) but the food once it came out and the drinks when they finally came around to serving it was good. \u00a0So long as you don't come in starving, you will have good beer and good food.", "I don't like to write bad reviews, but I feel it is being honest.I had not been to this location in about 2 years, and, sadly, it has changed.The location is great...The Flamingo is a great building, and they should allow access to, he pool...but I digress.The reasons for the one star are as follows:1-;Service was spotty and inattentive...my waitress really acted like being there was a nuisance at best.2- The food...In the past, I have always just ordered some simple pub grub...a burger or wrap and see me fries, etc...nothing exotic. \u00a0It was quick, plentiful, tasty, and pretty much impossible to goof up.I was proven that you CAN screw something up.My burger was dry, the fries cold, and it seemed lik only a half order of fries or half the burger I remember.All in all, I regretted my decision to stop in...I hope it was a bad day, but, based on other reviews, I fear it might be more....If management reads this, please prove me wrong by doing something.", "The service is the worse. Very friendly staff, but horribly run establishment. I tried to hint to the guy that seemed to be running the show that night that things were a little behind, but he did not seem to care too much.

If so, I'm ready to change my assessment.", "I go to Bar Louie for the boneless wing with \u00a0the enfuego sauce, so good!

I've gone at 2 in the afternoon & been the only person there & i've gone at midnight and been somewhat packed & both times my waitress was slow. & not slow because the food was taking long, slow to come check on us, slow to bring drinks, slow to refill drinks, just a very bad experience. That was the time at night, in the daytime, the waitress sat at the bar the whole time in plain sight & was slow with everything.Only reason i'm giving 2 stars is because the Salmon Sliders are GREAT. I'll come back just for those but won't expect good service", "Over the years since my first review this restaurant has fell off like Chris Tucker after Friday. The service got 10x worst which is saying something considering their style was always been \"do-it-yourself\" , get your own seat, get your own menu and based off how slow the service you might as well get your own food and drink. I could deal with that and be cool just because I'm that type of person. BUT I had the worst experience i have ever had at any establishment in my entire life... I go just for old times sake.I know the service sucks and I could throw a rock and find better food elsewhere, but I go against better logic and decide to just go. Of course we have to find our own seats then sit and play \"Who's Your Waiter Today?\" for 10 mins. We ordered drinks and waited another 15 mins before our waiter returns with the wrong drinks... It's cool though. It wasn't like I expected them to be perfect. The rest of the experience was typical, the place was pretty quiet but I couldn't tell who was on duty and who was just hanging out after their shift..typical shit...We asked for our check which was the time we were notified that the computer system was down... So we received our check on a napkin and was asked to pay in cash or wait until corporate called with a solution... Now I'm pissed...We ask for the manager because now the situation had really gotten out of hand. The manager and his 5 man crew come to the table to intimidate us and offers us free coupons for their overpriced under flavored appetizers... No thanks.I go to the bathroom because now I'm buzzed and pissed and I see all the wait staff posted at the door mean mugging other patrons that are also waiting for their computer system...Long story short, we paid half for our bill and left no tip, which was awkward for our waiter because he chased us down the street to confirm the amount we left and we were like yeah... That was it.. no tip... So yeah... We won't be back...", "Service was terrible and drinks were watered down. You can tell they were short staffed. Food was decent to say the least.", "I've been sitting at this bar waiting for a drink for the last 23 minutes. The bar tender with the waist length locs has all but ignored me.

DIet Coke. But I'd like for the styrofoam cup, normally associated with your sweet tea, to be the container used for said diet coke. You see, the styrofoam cup, although destroying our environment, keeps my diet coke colder longer, and keeps the ice from melting. I'm a selfish bastard, I know, but that's how I'd like my frosty beverage today. \"We use the plastic cups for drinks. You want a sweet tea?\"3. IN what should have been a scene from a movie, after sitting at the drive through window for close to 15 minutes waiting for someone to bring me my Sprite and small fries, the window opened and out came a cloud of sweet smelling smoke, and the guy said, \"Wait, wait wait wait wait hold up. What did you order, man?\" A large sprite and a small fry. \"Oh, man, yeah. Our ice-cream machine is down.\" Ok, I'll just have a sprite and small fries then. \"Cool, here you go.\" (Hands me a bag containing several big macs and a filet-o-fish.)4.

Thank god I sample my fries before completely leaving the lot. My fries was cold as hell. I mean no heat @ all. I was upset after waiting in line a long time. I went back to the window and told the young lady my issue, and she ask \"who sold you the fries\"? How in the hell would I know who put the fries in the bag? She told me to come around to the front door. At this time she told me she had just drop some fresh fries. My reply was no...your service is totally unacceptable. You should have drop fresh fries when you took my money. I don't want anything from this Mcdonald's. Give me my money back. The manager then came to the window. I told em to feel these fries...I can not believe you \u00a0tried to sell me these cold fries. My money was refunded...I'm sure the staff has a policy and procedure to follow. Certain standards to work by. Totally unaware of the consequences behind being negligent while handling food. Cross contamination, food borne illness, salmonella, etc. This is why standards should be followed at all times. Furthermore, it is the manager's responsibility to make sure everyone is doing his or her job correctly. If the staff gave me cold fries below the temperature of 40 degrees, do you think I was the first customer to be served like this. Now we have to imagine other things that maybe going on in the back while the food is being handled. The service, attitude, focus, cleanliness, quality of food etc. \u00a0 in the day time is excellent.", "A JOB SHOULDN'T JUST BE A JOB TO ANYONE!!! IF U DONT LIKE YOUR JOB QUIT!! It's that simple. Don't make everyone else miserable because you are! This place is so ghetto and unprofessional I don't care if it's Mc Donald's I expect good service anywhere I go!! To come thru the drive thru and get cussed out because I asked for fresh fries is beyond crazy!! I was told to get my ass out and walk to the window for my fries instead of \"mam I'm sorry we can't bring your fries out but could u please drive around and I'll have them fresh for you\"!! Then as the manager approaches he tells him to calm down instead of taking control of the situation ,removing the loud obnoxious worker ,giving me my fries handling the situation he sat there!! I came back to bring the food back because of the service and asked for my money back and asked how could u let him disrespect u as a manager his response was \"HE DIDNT DISRESPECT ME HE DISRESPECTED U\" wow instead of coming back to this place ILL STARVE I TRIED TO GET SOMETHING FAST ON THE GO DIDNT REALIZE I WOULD GO THROUGH THIS MUCH TROUBLE FOR A FISH SANDWICH AND FRIES!!

I usually get the drunken noodles with tofu which is delicious, though I have to order it mild unless I want to drink a gallon of water with my meal to cool my tongue. Last time, I also got the garlic tofu and vegetables, which was surprising yummy for being such a basic dish! I'm definitely adding that to my usual order. Like other reviewers have said, delivery is very fast and the delivery man was very nice. Great \u00a0restaurant to satisfy those Thai cravings!", "Someone else called this place consistent, and I'd have to agree. I much prefer Siam down the street, but this place is much more generally tasteful I think. The atmosphere isn't much, but it's also not like someone's weird house. The food isn't the best Thai, but I think there is probably nothing actually gross on the menu. And the prices are the same as all of the other Thai places on this street (except for Snail, which imagines itself the fancy one).My first Thai Iced Tea came from Thai 55, and I will never forget that -- instead I have spent lots of time trying in vain to recreate it on my own (the true problem is that I am limited in the amount of sweetened condensed milk I wish to knowingly consume).All in all, Thai 55 is serviceable. I guess the most important thing to note is that it is NOT Pho 55. Though Thai 55 was the start of the 55th street Asian Empire, it's not as flashy or expensive as its younger counterpart Pho 55, and I like it more for that.Panang curry is always a good choice -- sweet and nutty.", "My buddy brought me here one Saturday afternoon and swore by this place. He's a way more adventurous eater than I am I must say, I'm not a closed minded eater, I'm just more of a go-for-what-you-know type guy especially when you get up into the $20+ range. Food was not bad at all, nice and spicy, and modestly priced from what I remember. Friendly waitstaff, decent parking, no real issues, just beware for those who are faint of tongue and stomach because this is genuine Thai and those spices can mess you up if you're not used to that!", "Not the best Thai I've ever had, but it's consistent. I've never dined at the restaurant; only ordered delivery. The delivery drivers are fast, courteous and super nice. The phad Thai is kind of bland, even asking for 5 star spice...but we can add our own from the collection we have at home, no big deal.This is definitely the go to place for delivery in our house.", "Meal was average for me. Too much soy sauce in the fried rice. Didn't enjoy the crispy noodles with with very little eggs in it. Waitress was in a hurry to take order and disappear inside. What I liked most was the environment with a calm view. I prefer Pho 55 even though it's the same owner.", "Out of all the Pad Tai here on 55th street I think it is the best here, and for the best price. I favor this Thai Iced Tea of all of them as well. The waiters aren't that friendly as they are in Snail though... Sometimes I go to Snail just so I won't have to deal with the people here. There are no \"please\" \"thank you\" or any common courtesy attitudes as far as it comes to service. Asking for a straw is like a gamble because they'll roll their eyes or make it seem like we are such a bother. In better words: any requests are a little annoying to them. I asked if I could sit near an outlet, he looked at me as if I had asked for a free meal. (No he did not sit me by an outlet)But see here is my thing: I've been here 3 times and every time I order the sweet coconut banana dessert they never have it! And it's always a diff weird excuse. So I guess I'm walking to the Snail Thai to get my dessert. Boooo", "We went here with friends that live in Hyde Park, the food was good. \u00a0everything was seasoned well and the portions were large enough to share or take some home.

Thai 55, was pretty good. It's a nice quant authentic experience. As you know, our Supper Club focuses on finding BYOB restaurants, that we haven't gone to before. After the third year of doing this, you can imagine that it gets hard to find something new. However, I can't believe this place has never been on our radar. \u00a0We started off with the deluxe appetizer plate. They cut it in half for us to share everything. Nothing was too amazing here, just ok. Then we ordered a smorgasbord of food. A few of the items were the green curryRoasted duck, Bangkok chicken, lobster sauce seafood, shrunken noodles and a rice dish. Please note there were like 8 of us. LOL. We shared everything and were pretty amazed with the duck curry, drunken noodles and lobster sauce seafood. All were items, the waitress suggested. All and all, this place is worth at least one try! You can dine in or carry out. I could imagine it becoming your neighborhood go to place for Thai.", "If I could give this place a 0, I would. I ordered food from this place, their famous Bangkok combination - rice and chicken. The food was absolutely disgusting and looked much worse than it tasted. It was like shredded dog food mixed with some very strong mustard oil. I got very sick from eating the food, and when I complained to the manager he said he wouldn't offer any refunds or exchanges or even an apology. I would never try this place again and I would never recommend it. So save yourself the trouble, just don't do it! Find another place, any other place.", "Ew. I ordered the Drunken Noodle and Green Curry Fried Rice. The noodle barely had any noodles at all and was basically just ground beef stir fried with way too much sauce. The Green Curry Fried Rice had no flavor at all and the vegetables were undercooked. I'll second what someone else said about the spring rolls. They are vile and a waste of money. I got take out and had to re-cook everything at home to make it palatable. Don't waste your time on this place. Try Pho 55 or Snail.", "Uncooked vegtables. Not flavorful. Maybe it was a bad night...", "Been here a few times now. The food is decent - large enough quantities so you leave full, but not the best in terms of taste. This place has never been close to full when I've gone in (~noon and ~6 PM).The pad thai here is decent enough that I would go back for it, and the entrees are all okay. The great part about Thai 55 is that the food comes out pretty quickly and is not very expensive (~$8 on average per entree). However, the best part about Thai 55 is their honeydew smoothie with tapioca. Sure, it isn't as good as some of the places in Chinatown, but given the lack of any bubble tea in the Hyde Park area, this place isn't bad at all! And you can get it to-go, so maybe next time I'll skip the food and go for the smoothie.Food: 2.5/5Smoothie: 4/5", "My family has been coming to Thai 55 for years! We love their food.

The male waiter came to our table and asked us if we were ready to order our food, and we were, so we gave him our food order. But, then he preceded to walk away without asking if we wanted some drinks. Is it me? or is that supposed to be waiter protocol. Anyway, they brought out our food and then we never saw them again. Literally. I wanted another drink and I couldn't find them (the male or the female waiter) to wave them down. They were behind the counter in the back. They never came back to our table to check on us. However, when new customers came in, they magically appeared and I was able to get the waitress's attention to get another Coke. Then a few minutes later, when the waitress came to give the new customers their food, she asked if we wanted boxes and I said yes, but we wanted to still sit and talk, and she said, \"ok.\" BTW, the place was practically empty.15 minutes later, we didn't receive our boxes, and, again, neither waiter was nowhere to be found. I went to the back and I asked the waitress where our boxes were. She just looked at me and said \"ok.\" As if we never established that she was getting our boxes. Then the male waiter came, boxed up our food, and gave us the check. Then the waitress came out and they started speaking a different language to each other. I know they were talking about us. But, no worries, they will never get my hard earned money again. That was the worst customer service I have ever had. No wonder why people just do carry out there.", "NOPE! I hate to do this, but I am PISSED. I have ordered from this place before, but I usually pick the food up. I have a friend that lives off of 51st and Cottage Grove.

AN HOUR LATER, we get a call saying the delivery driver \"won't go over there\". WAYMENT. WHAT?!?Could you have not said that seemingly elitist/racist/ridiculous statement when we gave you the address at 7:45? Did you make the food then have the nerve to tell me I'd have to come get it when you called at 8:50? You think that's reasonable customer service? Not good....", "I live in Hyde Park and typically go to Argyle for good Asian food but was desperate for dinner one evening when I decided to try this place. The decor was nice, clean and simple. I ordered a classic Thai fresh vegetarian spring roll which was TERRIBLE! Super think, flimsy and cut into 6, 1/2 inch pieces. Ate one bite and we left the rest.

Our waitress was great, very attentive. The lighting was not too dark or bright, and the music was fun and not too loud. Really everything about this place was great... except for the food itself, which is kind of the most important factor, and why I'm only giving it 2 stars.We got off to a good start with drinks... My friend and I both got the Heat Seeker cocktail and it was delicious! The focaccia bread was good, but typically I think of focaccia as having a lot of herbs, spices, oil, maybe a little cheese baked in... this bread did not have any of that. Also, I think it would have more of an upscale, Italian vibe if it came with oil and pepper than the butter.We ordered the salad from the specials menu, and my understanding was that it was supposed to come with pear. However, there was no pear on the salad... my boyfriend said he thought it was in the dressing, but either way, I could not taste it at all. It was also quite overdressed.For our entrees, my friend got the duck, which tasted like duck but looked nothing like it, which was very strange. The pieces of meat on her plate were enormous and looked more like pork. I got the baked mushroom rotolo. I guess I was expecting something like a baked mac n' cheese, where the noodles, ricotta, and mushrooms would all be baked in the pan together... not so. It came in a pan but the noodles had been wrapped to look a bit like sushi? There was some type of meat in it but I'm not sure what, and there did not appear to be any arugula. The ricotta didn't taste fresh, and the overall dish was severely under-seasoned. My boyfriend ordered a seafood dish that he also reported as under-seasoned. The other problem with the entrees is, they were quite expensive given the portion sizes. If the entrees were flavorful and high quality I would be able to forgive the steep prices, but unfortunately, they just weren't.I'd go back to this place for a cocktail and would maybe even give their pizza a shot, but I will definitely not be ordering any other entrees again.", "I really wanted to like the place because we had an amazing waiter and because of him in giving it 2 stars unfortunately I was extremely disappointed with this place.The food was not only underwhelming but not good at all. For appetizer we made the mistake of ordering a seafood platter which was horrible and overpriced, I had the octopus for main entrance and although the octopus itself was ok it did not go well with the rest of the dish.We were also unlucky because we were sit close to the door and we had to keep our coats on because it was super cold.I don't think I will be coming back and I can't recommend this place.", "While the food was just OK, it's really the whole experience that gets two stars.We arrived for 6pm dinner during Restaurant Week and it was nearly empty. After ordering the Restaurant Week special of venison (which we figured would come out quickly since it was the special) and the bucatini (which takes, what, 15 minutes to cook?), we were really surprised when it took a full hour for our entrees to arrive. During this time, the waitress didn't check in to let us know that the food was coming or apologize for the lengthy wait. After we ate our entrees, my friend was getting a dessert as part of the restaurant week menu and I ordered the soft serve. Again we waited--about 20 minutes. My friend actually had to leave because she had a meeting to get to (and we were now an hour and 45 minutes into our meal) so I held down the fort. Her dessert arrived about five minutes after she left. Mine (a dish of ice cream that I assume was made in advance) arrived five to ten minutes after that. So yes, I wait like half an hour for ice cream.What takes so long here?!The waitress did seem to feel bad that my friend had to leave before our meal was over, so she comped my soft serve. While I appreciated this, I missed out on finishing a meal with a good friend (not to mention she paid for something she couldn't eat) and we spent most of our meal annoyed that it was taking so long. In total, it took two hours for us to eat. Again, it wasn't super crowded--probably two-thirds full when I left.The food was fine but nothing I would come here for again. My pasta was flavorful but had clearly been sitting for quite a while because the noodles were all congealed together into a gloppy mess. Not worth the price.", "The 4 of us came here for brunch on a Sunday (quite the field trip from Old Town) and it was such a let down. The place wasn't even half full so not sure why the service was so slow. Besides my friend's coffee cups being filled, we had to flag them down a few times to get waters filled. The food came out slow as well and it was fairly pricey for the portions. My friend's small omelet came with nothing else ($12) as did the brioche French toast. If you are in the mood for fried chicken and waffles, you may not go wrong here. The chicken was decent and as were the waffles but nothing great. For $18 it better be awesome. The side of fingerling potatoes were tasty...cuz it was fried and dressed well. The burger and fries I shared were a big disappointment ($16). we asked for medium but it came out burnt/rubbery/well done in some parts and just raw in the middle. the fries were so oily too. I was disgusted that I stopped eating both and I usually eat anything in front of me. Each of us left something behind on our plates. Given the slow service and lack luster food, I'm likely not going to return.", "We came here for their Sunday brunch and more than half of the restaurant was empty at noon and still the service was so slow. We all ordered coffees and we would have to flag our server down to get refills which was very annoying.

You are welcome to try the place if you are willing to put up with the slow service.", "Came for dinner on Valentine's Day and absolutely loved the meal and wine pairings. \u00a0My only complaint is that the service model is very strange...no fewer than 5 people served us throughout the night. \u00a0All were very kind and hospitable but it really hindered the pace of our meal. \u00a0Overall, I'd highly recommend A10, especially when specialty menus are available.", "I only ate and drank at the bar but they do have a full dining area. \u00a0They had fried pig ears on the bar menu! \u00a0OMG, the first time I've ever seen this. \u00a0Of course, had to order it. \u00a0When it came out, it was not what I expected. \u00a0I thought it was going to actually look like a pig's ear and more like jerky texture (I had a yellow lab that loved smoked pig ears). \u00a0So, I was presented with a bowl of puffy, deep fried sections of ears. \u00a0It looked just like pork rinds, and pretty much tasted like them too. \u00a0They are pretty addictive especially with the fontina sauce they had on the side. \u00a0But here's note of caution. \u00a0Don't eat more than one order. \u00a0They taste so light and cripsy but I felt I drank a gallon of oil afterwards. \u00a0Don't get me wrong, I'd so do it again. \u00a0It was VERY tasty. \u00a0The beers on tap are local and really good, changing them to meet the seasonal food offerings. \u00a0Well though out. \u00a0Check it out!", "I feel I should preface this by saying that if I were only reviewing the atmosphere and the service, this would be a 5 star review. The servers were great, the tables were nice, everything looked amazing.The problem I had with this place was that all of the food just tasted, \"bad\". The menu was full of mouthwatering options but when the real test came, the food just didn't taste good.I went on a Thursday evening after work. I ventured down to Hyde Park since my girlfriend is currently in Law School there and I wanted to take her some place nice. The place was not packed but not empty either, about half the tables were full and they had plenty of waitstaff to cover everyone that was there. They seated us at a nice corner table where we had a good view of the restauraunt.We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 main entrees. The shaved apple & Kohlrabi came first. Neither of us really loved the dish and there were hardly any apple slices on the plate. We chaulked it up to not liking Kohlrabi which we had never tried before and hoped that our next plate would be more to our liking.The 2nd appetizer we ordered was the Roasted Brussels Sprouts. We both agreed that the Brussel sprouts would have been much better had they been crispier, and the flavor profile of the dish was just off. Small problems though since the wine we ordered was great and was making us pretty easy to please.When our entrees arrived we were a little surprised at how small they were and were glad that we had forced ourselves to pick through our less than perfect appetizers. I had the Pappardelle with shrimp and my girlfriend had the Chitarra alla bolognese.First, the Chitarra was pretty flavorless. The lamb was dry and the dish as a hole sort of tasted like spaghetti and meatballs with flavorless meatballs and no sauce.And for the Pappardelle, well, the shrimp tasted like they had gone to the frozen aisle at the grocery store and bought the cheapest shrimp in a bag, and then let them sit in their freezer for a few more months. The shrimp were tiny and the overall dish had an after taste of mediocre seafood. I normally love seafood and shellfish is my favorite, but this dish really didn't do much for me.None of the food was inedible and all of it was \"okay\" but for the price point I expected a lot better food. I expected flavors that would have me wishing for more but what I got was barely enough to fill me up and a $80 check.If you're in Hyde Park and want a fancy sit down restaurant there aren't a whole lot of options. I would highly recommend venturing a little further and finding something better but if you absolutely have to stay local, I would look a little longer before coming to A10. Surely there most be a few other fancy sitdowns in the area and there are definitely restaurants that serve better food than this.", "Not worth the hype. Or the prices.Seems like it's still trying to find it's identity. I feel that only certain restaurants can pull off the \"no pricing\" on the menu. A-10 has definitely not earned those stripes.Always get great service at the bar, so stick with the wine list or cocktails.", "Went there for a sunday brunch and ordered a Chicken and waffles and 1 slice of french toast. French toast is really good. The waffle on the other hand was not that good, not chewy and it looked dry. Chicken is fine(boneless). One of my friends ordered \"the burger\" and was also not satisfied. Service was good though. I would probably see how they do with dinner.", "I was very pleasantly surprised by my experience here. \u00a0It was actually a great place. \u00a0I ended up going here after waking up far too late for brunch that I decided to go ahead with a early dinner. \u00a0 This turned out to be a great option. \u00a0We ended up eating at around 4 pm. \u00a0There were tons of great options for this timeframe. \u00a0Plenty of bar snacks available for $6 and such.The cocktails were great and well balanced. \u00a0I really enjoyed the apricot nipper which is a little bit sweeter than the cocktails that I normally drink, but it had a good fruit flavor that didn't mask the strength of the rye whiskey that drew my eyes towards that drink.As the food goes, the one thing I had to complain about is that the food came out of the kitchen far too quickly. \u00a0It was kind of to their detriment as well as it made the dinner a little less pleasant as well as costing them me ordering another drink. \u00a0We ordered a lot of plates, but they were sending out plate after plate almost simultaneously as they were made rather than coursing things out a little bit.The focaccia was great and came with subtle roasted garlic that had a bit of acid from balsamic to balance things out with the olive oil. \u00a0The wood fired mushroom was a good dish. \u00a0The egg was perfectly cooked and the polenta was really creamy if I had one complaint it would be that that because the mushrooms weren't cut, it made them a little difficult to share.I had crispy pig ears, which turned out to be pretty fantastic. \u00a0They came out with a texture that reminds you of pork rinds and they were super light and crisp. \u00a0The seasoning on them was slightly spicy and they also came with a cheese fondue dipping sauce that was fantastic.The saffron gemelli was probably my favorite of a ll the dishes we had there. \u00a0It had a good salty flavor from the cod roe and it had a deep and rich tomato flavor from the sun dried tomato. \u00a0The pasta was cooked perfectly.The kohlrabi salad combined two of my favorite things, kohlrabi and honey crisp apple but I wish that there was a little less acid in the dish.The buccatini carbonara was fantastic and had all of the things you want in a carbonara, though I would have liked a bit more of the guanchale.With the banana pot de creme, it was good, but it used bananas that tasted a little green, and I just wish that were either riper or caramelized a bit to add a bit more sweetness and make them more palatable.", "I hate it took me soo long to try it out. \u00a0We decided to go last night for our 5th Anniversary, great choice!Hy hubby ordered the scallops which are a must, they were deliciously sweet & very flavorful with sauce. \u00a0He also had the salmon was bursting with flavor from all directions. I ordered the quail which was tasty but a little dry for me. There was not enough greens given to go with the size of the quail or they were just soo damn good I wanted more..lolOur only issue was the server, we felt like we had to pull information from her instead of giving that first visit speech most places provide. She was also a mumbler, not sure if she was new, she didn't seem confident in knowing the info about the menu.", "We arrived to an empty restaurant which should have been the first sign to run. I have visited this location about 1 year ago, and at that time it was bustling, service was prompt, and everything was tasty. That was not the case this night! First, the drafty area froze us in our seats (we watched the shades flutter against a closed window!)The drinks arrived with a hair in it (!), we waited 15 minutes for the focaccia appetizer (which must have been sitting out, because it arrived lukewarm) and the beans in the soup were still hard! The only thing that was tasty was the salad (but really now... It takes effort to mess up a salad). We waited and waited for the entree, (the meatball special) only for the final disappointment - it was overloaded with salt. This place was a good location in the past, but something has gone terribly wrong. Hurry in and wait for exorbitant prices for amateur hour.", "I really wanted to like A10, but almost everything we got was unexciting, especially for the price. Here's a menu rundown: Garlic focaccia: legitimately very good. On the other hand, when was the last time you paid $8 for bread and oil at an Italian restaurant? Pasta special (red wine rigatoni with beef short ribs): I was so excited about this dish, but sadly it flopped for me. There was almost no beef in the darn thing! There was, however, a plethora of beef juice (perhaps an attempt at sauce?) that was strangely bitter covering everything. I wound up transferring all the pasta/meat/veggies to a different plate in an attempt to avoid the sauce. Oh, and the carrots? They were barely cooked and placed on top without being cut, making it difficult to incorporate into the dish.Soft serve: basically flavored Italian ice. Not sure there was any cream in there at all. Maple goat cheese mousse: first surprise: the mousse was freezing cold rather than room temp. Second surprise: no discernible maple flavor.", "I came here last week to celebrate some good news with my boyfriend after trying to go our nearby favorite, the Promontory. The wait was 30 minutes so we decided to head to A10 and were not disappointed. My cocktail, the pamplemouse ($11) was light and delicious and we shared the carmelized bacon pizza - which was not what we expected. Instead of a typical flatbread, was on soft and crusty French bread and at only $9 and excellent deal. The decor is warm, with great touches, the best of which are the ladders that hold some of the liquor bottles by the bar. We've found a new neighborhood favorite", "A-10 had good service; but for $70 I expected more than just one good tasting plate of food. I felt as though my wife got jiped when she ordered a bland crab cake and a loaf of focaccia bread with cheese and thick cut bacon on it.I'm basically expected more for A10's price and it's implied hype when I walk past. Well I satisfied my desire to explore what I hadn't experienced and I don't need to go back.", "Daiquiri 8$ Happy Hour Special - takes like pina colada meets fruit punch. \u00a0Yum.1/2 dozen oysters \"naked cowboy style\" $18- I didn't like the \"cowboy style.\" \u00a0It tasted like/looked like oysters on the half shell served with a sprinkling of crushed red pepper, \u00a0and small slices of pickled green tomato (I'm not even sure if it was tomato but the size and the seeds looked like tomato). \u00a0One of the oysters was fishy to the point where I was worried it was on the verge of going bad. \u00a0Bleh. \u00a0Other than the one smelly oyster, they were \"ok\" just not to my taste. \u00a0On the bright side, I didn't sick or anything, don't worry.Bucatini - the flavors were good (I liked the crunchy texture of the garlic and ?breadcrumbs) and the poached egg was perfect. \u00a0However I have a problem with the noodles. \u00a0I know A10 makes the noodles fresh, but when I fork up noodles are they supposed to look like stiff pipe cleaners? \u00a0I like toothsome noodles with some bite but this was a bit much. \u00a0I wouldn't even say they are undercooked. \u00a0The carbonara is very rich which makes me think they purposely made the noodles that way. \u00a0Again, flavors were good, but the noodles were not for me.Chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me - my favorite of the meal! \u00a0I can't say anything bad here :) \u00a0I loved the graham cracker crusted toasted marshmallow topper. \u00a0The whipped marscapone and the chocolate niblets were perfect with the rich chocolate custard.All in all - a good addition to Hyde Park but disappointing when compared to other offerings in the city (and for the price I expect more).My server, Clay was excellent.", "So here I am a Hyde Parker. \u00a0Heard about this place a lot, read mixed reviews and have picked up 2 people from here both of whom said the food was average. \u00a0Too hyped up. \u00a0Add to that their logo to me looks something I would find at a not the greatest Chinese Restaurant. \u00a0Wife had always said we should check it out but I was the party pooper each time till last night. \u00a0Wife made reservations for my birthday to take me out here. \u00a0I have to admit I was trying to go here till the last hour but gave in and boy am I glad I did.The staff here is some of the nicest. \u00a0You will come across service at some places which is great because it has to be. \u00a0Then you come across a place like this where you can clearly tell and feel that the service is great not because it has to be but because the staff WANT to provide great service.We ordered the POLENTA DI MAIS (please don't stop giving this to me. \u00a0It was OUT OF THE WORLD.) and the SHAVED APPLE & KOHLRABI which was different and was good.For the main entree, we ordered a mushroom pizza and the SAFFRON GEMELLI. \u00a0The pizza is basically toppings on a focacio bread but it was good. \u00a0The gemelli was awesome too; a bit salty was my only complaint but I've know that I like pasta with a little less salt to begin with and I got carried away with the service here so much that I completely forgot to request it with less salt. \u00a0GREAT flavor though.The final touch was when the bill was brought to me and then I was also given a signed birthday card by every staff that was there. \u00a0NICE TOUCH GUYS. \u00a0As we walked out too, the smile on the hostess's face and the thank you for coming with a genuine smile. \u00a0DEFINITELY MY REGULAR PLACE NOW.", "Great brunch in Hyde Park.

There were and still are three Thai restaurants on the 55th Street stretch and I rotated my visits among the three. Having not been to Hyde Park in quite some time, I returned to Siam Restaurant.The owner who was there when I used to go was still there. And he remembered me enough to remember than I had tried to learn Thai by ordering food. I still got through much of the brief conversation in Thai.Potstickers. Yellow curry shrimp. Thai iced tea.There was a reason why Siam Restaurant had a draw more than the other two nearby Thai restaurants. The potstickers were not al dente and the yellow curry shrimp had a hearty gravy as opposed to a thin base. I loved the smoky flavour of the Thai iced tea. There is no attention to decor and that is all made up for with some of the best Thai in the city. I'm sure that the next time I go back to Hyde Park for some food, it will be to Siam Restaurant. Kab kun krab.", "I LOVE Siam. Easily, best Thai in Hyde Park. I've been here so many times, I've eaten in, I've taken out, I've ordered by phone, I've ordered by GrubHub, in winter, in spring, in summer, in fall... this place really hits the spot.The BEST thing about Siam... well, they are numerous. First, this place has an incredible lunch and dinner special -- rice, soup, egg roll, your dish, for $8-$11. The choice is limited, but there are great things. The curries (panang!) and the basil chicken are good. Second, this place introduced me to kai tom kha soup. If you have never had this soup before, get it. It is delicious. You will be inspired. Third, the panpipe Titanic music on repeat. That is the definition of ambience. Fourth, this place is kind of a hidden gem. For some reason, except for the people who live nearby, most of Hyde Park doesn't really know about or come to this place -- they all frequent the more popular Snail and Thai 55. Fifth, I had Thai iced tea for the first time here. Now I am a junkie on sweetened condensed milk and have ventured so many times to try to make this stuff myself, unsuccessfully.The outside looks a little bit sketchy, and honestly so does the inside. It looks like you're sort of inside someone's house, if it were restaurant shaped and maybe a little sparse. I consider this an authenticity bonus, but you do you. There's stuff all over. But there is enough space for a lot of people to come in even without a reservation.While many of the dishes are really great, I've had a couple things here that are genuinely gross (one of them was the roast duck soup; sounds good in theory, not so good in practice -- though I had a friend who LOVES it, so who knows). Look out for these in the reviews -- I really do think that the mixed reviews on Siam come from people who chose poorly. If you order well, this place is amazing.It's BYOB, and if you bring your own beer or wine, they'll help you open it and give you glasses and no sass. Lost a star for the occasional gross dish, gained one for BYOB. Classy joint.", "I love me some Thai food. Really I do. In particular I have a slight obsession with curry, so it is always really really hard for me to not order curry whenever Thai is on the menu for dinner. I tried this restaurant recently as a large delivery order, so perhaps things are different if you eat there, since some of the pictures on here make the curry seem more like what I love--thick and yummy and flavorful. The curry we got--one order of green and one yellow--was just kind of watery. Some of the good curry flavor was there, but I love having some brown rice or fried rice or even some extra rice noodles to mop up tasty curry. There is something about how curry can soak into rice that makes me so happy inside, but this place just didn't quite take me there. That said, the egg rolls were pretty good and their noodle dishes--we got a few--also were pretty tasty as well. The crab rangoons were so so and their spiced orange chicken type of dish also was so so, but I do appreciate the amount of cashews in some of the dishes we ordered. So all in all, this place was good, but not amazing, but it is super affordable delivery and they clearly can handle large orders as well, so decent spot!", "Siam definitely has the best Pad Thai in Hyde Park.", "Love these guys. I only order carry out and have not had a bad meal yet. The pick up is never wrong and the food is pipping hot at each pick up. I always get the combination fried rice and basil beef. Always good. I was able to try one of their soups and it was amazing. I never had a chance to dine in, but pick up is legit. Ordering from them now.", "Still the best authentic Thai restaurant in Hyde Park.Their roast duck basil is to die for. If you can take spicy, ask them for special \"Thai chili\" version of that dish.The fish cake is okay.", "Reviews say that this was the best Thai food in Hyde Park, and I completely agree (feel free to read my reviews of the other places). I came here and got the drunken noodles and panang curry. First of all, they have very good portions. The drunken noodle was pretty good - although I wish it was a bit spicier. The panang curry was thick and pretty delicious. I actually took some of the leftover curry home, watered it down a bit the next day, and added some noodles to it to have a second meal. It seems like most people like this place's curry, so definitely give that a shot.Next, the food came out pretty quickly, which was good because I was starving. The servers here don't really wait on you, so if you want that kind of service, I would try one of the other Thai places. I personally like being left alone during a meal, so I thought the service was perfectly fine.Overall, if I crave Thai food, I'll be coming here.", "BEWARE DELIVERY!!!! \u00a0They told me 40 minutes when I called. It is now over 1 1/2 hours later and the food still hasn't showed up. They told me it was on its way when I called when it hadn't shown up after an hour. Still waiting!!!!!!!!!Update: now it is almost 2 hours. Still waiting.Shame on you. We are very hungry.", "My mom and sister went here a couple of weeks ago and thought I'd like it, so we all went today. \u00a0I read all the Yelp reviews and wasn't exactly sure what to expect since they varied so vastly.I LOVED IT.We came in at the same time as a group of about 10 people, and the waiter sat both groups quickly, and took our order first (he implied that he knew it'd take the other group a lot longer, so he wanted to expedite our order). \u00a0We ordered the fried squid for all of us, my mom had the shrimp lard nar, my sister had the baby clam chili, and I had the basil mussels and beef pad siew with beef. \u00a0I've been eating at Thai food spots before they became really popular in Chicago, and I often lament that restaurants no longer pan fry the noodles (to get some texture and flavor on them) before adding the sauce, which makes the noodles really soft with tons of gloppy sauce. \u00a0This was the opposite. \u00a0There wasn't a bunch of sauce and the noodles were al dente and flavorful. \u00a0My mussels were also wonderful; I could just eat the veggies, sauce, and rice from that dish any day. \u00a0The fried squid was cooked to perfection as well.Our waiter was very nice, attentive, and even lamented the drastic changes of weather with with us as we left.I can't give it all 5 stars since I've only been once, but I will DEFINITELY be back.", "I read the reviews and decided to go out on a limb. The food was just mediocre, and I'm saying this while keeping Hyde Park in mind. I ordered the spring roll, Bangkok Chicken, and beef Lad Na. The spring roll was made with a thicker wrap than I'm used to. That, not the flavor, was what stood out most to me about this appetizer. The Bangkok Chicken was fried and sweet but not noteworthy. I can't comment on the beef Lad Na because we received the shrimp version. No big deal, just check your order carefully before walking out the door. This was the best dish of the three. The best thing about this dish is the price when compared to neighboring restaurants.I ordered carry-out. I don't think I could have eaten here. The decor is a major turn off but it was the smell that was a deal breaker. Sometimes restaurants have that bathroom smell. Not the foul, just used bathroom smell. The smell that public restrooms take on over time. Maybe this was \u00a0one off occurrence. I don't know but I will forever associate food from here with that smell.", "Food was ok, portions were quite small. \u00a0I ordered basil chicken and it was ground chicken, not regular chicken! \u00a0I felt that should have been specified. \u00a0I feel since they're in competition with two others on the block, they'd step it up a bit better.", "What else to do on a Saturday night when you're feeling ill (no, really... pain meds make you loopy & your stomach less than happy) then venture out for some soup? Glad I decided to call this local gem for some wonton soup. I was extremely happy when I called seeing as though it was -20 minutes before closing & they were happy to take my order. I've called other places before & have been turned away since it's close to closing time - hey, I get it, everyone's gotta go home, but sometimes you just need something simple & quick without breaking the bank. Within 15 minutes (including the short walk over), I was greeted by the guys behind the counter who've remembered me from the past 2 visits, & warm container of goodness. It was my first time having their soup & I wasn't disappointed - I had wished I got the large because it was THAT good. While the wontons could have been bigger, I appreciated the bean sprouts & BBQ pork. The broth was perfect & my *currently* sensitive stomach couldn't be happier. Other visits I've gotten crab rangoon (YUM), bamee noodles no broth (very good), & pad see ew (spot on). Definitely worth a trip over!", "Ordered the Bangkok chicken it was alright. And it came with plain rice. It tasted like sweet and sour chicken. It wasn't that bad but nor was it that great. I might try something again from this place in the future. For now, it's just okay. I'm still searching for the perfect Asian restaurant in Hyde Park!", "I heard this was the best place for authentic Thai food, but I think I must not have had the right dish. It wasn't that great, but I'm willing to give it another try, maybe with someone who knows what to order.They've got GREAT egg rolls.

One of the worst services I have ever experienced in Hyde Park. Dont waste your time, go to noodles instead.", "The atmosphere/decor here isn't very good, and the food isn't either. It's not bad, but it's not as good as the other nearby restaurants (e.g. The Snail, another thai place).

By default we have ordered from IFP several times.The thing??? The thing is, DO NOT EVEN think of ordering from them (especially for delivery) during ANY time that could be considered peak time. Peak time for them seems to be any time that normal people eat food. Their delivery service is SO BAD that they should not even offer it as a service. I had learned the hard way to ONLY order from IFP during non-peak times and then SPECIFICALLY ask how busy they are at that time. After recent experiences though, I will NEVER order from IFP again.As others have said, 3-hour wait times are the norm and not the exception. And don't think for one second that they wait until they can squeeze you in for delivery to make your pizza. They don't.

The texture of the protein in those two dishes grosses me out, looks like intestines. The soul veg specials are always great, the sides are good too but the mac n cheese is just alright to me. \u00a0They recently added cupcakes which are yummy! but $3 for a cupcake is insane to me so I only get them now and then. They follow a schedule which they post on their site and usually update the twitter/facebook as they go on the route. Sometimes there is diff trucks or a pedicab, etc but they do announce what they will be in advance. They will also go to specific locations on request as well.

Our favorite, hands down, of any vegan or non vegan we've had, is their mac and cheese. I don't know what they do to it but it's unreal.

Way too much food for one meal but it is easy to refridgerate for later. Somehow the mac n cheese was creamier than the kinds I've had that use dairy products. I was really impressed that they made it out to Merch Mart even though I requested a stop just hours before. Not sure how it works if you are off the beaten path, but I've noticed that they seem to stop in the Loop, River North, Hyde Park, Logan Square Pilsen and Rogers Park a lot.

Buffalo Chik'n Pita - If you were uneasy about the texture of the Chik'n tacos, try this!!! It's got a more \"meat\"-like texture and the sauce they put in with the pita is just absolutely delicious. I HIGHLY recommend this.BBQ Chik'n Pita - Same meat-like texture as the Buffalo Chik'n pita. It depends on what flavor you like, but I personally prefer the buffalo.Soul Vegetarian Sides - The Mac & Cheese was DELICIOUS!!! The BBQ Delights were good but this was also a dish I don't think most people would like by itself. I think what would have made this dish really good is if it were served with semi-sticky rice.

Simple sandwiches that end up tastier than a glance at the ingredients would suggest, bizarrely wonderful bread, great kettle chips and pickles, and fast service.

Their hot peppers are very unique and are superb. Only real problem with this location is that their onions can often be overly bitter and harsh, overpowering rather than complimenting.", "My issue with this Jimmy John's is quite simple: they say that they have the fastest service and if you are going to make a claim to that, back it up.

For a fast food place, this place wasn't that fast, and we were there for at least 10 minutes before our food came out. I was not a fan of my curry... there was plenty of goat in it, but it looked as it they had dropped thick brown mystery gop on it. My friend's jerk chicken was similar. For $10+, I can get a much better tasting meal elsewhere. Could not finish it, and neither of us felt like it would be worth it to bring back the leftovers (even though they were already packed in the default to-go bags). The interior of the place is pretty basic. There are only a few tall bar tables next to the windows to sit at (and the tables don't look like they're wiped down that often throughout the day).

Neither of our burgers came with fries or a drink but they did have combos. \u00a0The fries were only a 1.59 and they were really good.Because of all the different types of food they make it had an odd kind of smell but our burgers looked and taste fresh. \u00a0I can't believe I didn't take a picture of our burgers but next time I will because I will definitely \u00a0be back when I am in the area.Enjoy!", "You know that Seinfeld episode where Kramer tells Jerry he should return fruit that he doesn't like?

Today, I felt compelled to break my rule. I went to Nathan's, ordered the goat curry with red beans and rice as well as a beef patty. I was under a time crunch because I needed to be back at 3, and I was there at 2:20 or so. \u00a0Gave my order, and was told it would take ten minutes. \u00a0I'll be the first to say I did ask about the status of the order a couple of times, and the guy there was super sweet and assured me I would get it in time. A few minutes later, I hear the ping of an oven, and am given my order. \u00a0I walk out happily and reach home in time. It's foul. \u00a0The patty was nuked to flaccid yellow mess, no crustiness to speak of. \u00a0The goat curry? \u00a0Steaming hot, but mostly a pile of what I'm guessing is a premade curry sauce out of a bottle, and the meat was toughtoughtough. \u00a0I try, I really try to eat a few spoonfuls but it's disgusting. \u00a0Spicy, but disgusting.I do the unthinkable and call and tell him it was really bad. \u00a0Before I can even ask about getting my money back, he snaps, \"You were in a hurry!\" \u00a0I'm flabbergasted, but finally ask, \"Okay, can you tell me how my not being in a hurry would have made this better?\" \u00a0It's goat curry. \u00a0It's not as if they're able to make it from scratch in ten minutes. \u00a0It's a fast food place. \u00a0I'm okay with that. Uncle Joe's is the same way, but it's delicious. This, not so much. \u00a0At all. He keeps trying to argue and I finally tell him I'll just yelp about it.

Foods range from jerk chicken, burgers, hot dogs, gyros, etc. I only came here because I saw Jamaican on the front of their store. If ur gonna sell us on that then it must be damn good jerk chicken.

As i've said i've been going here for years so I am a fan but they are just so rude for no reason, i don't know how they stay open. For example, I called a week ago around 9:45 to ask what time they close (which is at 11) & the guy who answered was so rude about finding out what time they closed and telling me.

My biggest criticism is the food taste and value-I'm picky about my Italian (as I am ItalIan heritage) and I was really excited to see what the interpretation of my familial cuisine would be.Unfortunately, I found the saltiness of the food offputting. But there was a zest to the diavolo which was good and familiar. The fried ravioli came just thrown on an overly large plate which presentation wise was a little sloppy. The ravioli came smooshed in a small bowl with marinara rather than the advertised vodka sauce. The ravioli were light and delicate but were a bit overwhelmed by the sauce. My companions food was similarly plated and he also noted that everything was a little too heavy on salt.The prices were quite high when you factor in that there is neither bread nor salad included with any entree which is quite unusual in the realm of a restaurant advertising itself as Italian. Nothing was awful, but nothing was memorable enough to warrant the higher end price point.Honestly I truly hate to write a negative review, and some of this may be due to a bad day in the back of the house, the front of the house did a good job and I wouldn't take that away from them. But Truth is required to receive my truthful review and I feel like the trajectory of this establishment leans more towards appetizer/bar food and social gathering place with an Italian twist rather than a stand alone Italian restaurant.", "I visited Truth last night for the first time. I live only a few blocks from the restaurant, was happy to see it open and had been excited to try it out. The restaurant is pretty small, but cozy and nicely decorated. The bar is very inviting and there are plenty of tvs if you're interested in watching a game. I ordered the chopped salad, as I'm trying to eat a little more healthy. This may actually be the first time I've ever ordered a salad for dinner at a restaurant (I don't really care for them). Luckily this salad was great. It tasted fresh, had a lot of flavor with the chicken and feta, and the texture was good. I'm looking forward to going back to try more menu items. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to neighborhood residents. If we support new businesses, more will come.", "I was sooooooo disappointed this place didn't deliver better for the Bronzeville area. The website is sexy, alluring, and speaks to all of your senses. However, overall, this place fell really flat on its face.Arrival: I walked in and had no clue of what to do (neither did my dining companion). We just sat down and hoped for the best.Decor: It has a very loungy feel with the bar being the focal part of the restaurant. If you were dining, your table was covered with white linens. So there was almost like alternating tables between those dining and those hanging out. Equally interesting was that music was playing, connected to someone's phone not put on silent. It rang no less than 4 times! Uhm... who does that?Service: Our waiter was a gem. She tried her best and provided recommendations and you can tell she knew the menu, cocktails, and other tips. Food: This also fell pretty flat. The calamari seemed to be the frozen kind. All rings and \"canned\" coating so to speak. Think of the chicken rings from White Castle. I ordered the salad with chicken, which was pretty average. I mean I expected something much different. This entree was something I'd get from a local deli, not an Italian restaurant. My friend had a dish that looked pretty sad as well. I can't recall the name, but I plate food better than that.The straw that broke the camel's back.. They turned on Empire on all TVs up pretty loud. I mean again is this a restaurant or a lounge? I guess maybe my expectations are too high... Ultimately, if this place was positioned as a lounge, then I'd be more forgiving, but it's not and therefore I cannot really say I'd go back for food.. I'm hesitant to go back for drinks. They seem to have a big patio.. so maybe I'll give it another try next summer.", "Music was sultry.Chicken Scapiello was Delish,Service was sweet! Ambiance here is grown n sexy,perfect for any night- ladies night,date night,after work relaxation", "I visited Truth with my boyfriend for an early dinner/late lunch on Sunday. We started with the calamari which was pretty good - no tentacles if you don't care for them. He ordered the chicken Alfredo which was amazing. It has a bit of spice and the sauce is not overpowering the noodles (served with penne rather than fettuccine which I thought worked great). I ordered the chicken scarpiello (Sp?). It was ok. Huge portion and I liked being able to substitute turkey sausage for Italian sausage. I would definitely comeBack and order the chicken alfredo!! Very nice addition to the area!!", "Tonight was my second time going. The location is awesome and so is the parking. The decor is very nice. My first visit was for drinks after work and I had a pleasant experience, so when it was suggested to go for dinner I was open to it. (I didn't eat the first time, just mingled). Tonight there was some type of event happening and the majority of the crowd was there for it. Me and my friends were there for dinner and conversation. At one point the host of the event stated speaking to the entire room, so we were not able to talk to each other. \u00a0Since I was not a participant of their program it really ruined our girls night agenda. It would have been better if we were seated off to the side or told upon entering that the party was going to be loud so we could have decided if we wanted to stay. Since I was the last of my party to arrive, everyone had their water already. I asked the server three times for water before I finally got some. I ordered the penne with Italian sausage and diavolo sauce and the zucchini appetizer. Both dishes were mediocre at best. The zucchini was lacking salt/seasoning. The breading was crispy and a little oily and BLAND. The diavolo sauce tasted like prego. It wasn't nasty, but it did not start as fresh tomatoes and garlic and basil. It started in a can/jar. The dish was super basic as well as the plating. I got my food and was done eating before the rest of the food came for the table. When I asked for a to go box, I waited so long I just left the food on the table. Our server was bad. She walked by our table numerous times and had to be asked numerous times for things. I wanted to love this place. I really did. However, I did not. I will not be returning. The food was uber basic and not seasoned and the service was awful. The best thing about this place is the decor. I think if there is an overhaul, it would be worth trying because I would hate for it to close but I couldn't patronize this place without MAJOR changes.", "Let me start this review off by stating: I WANT TO SEE TRUTH WIN!!!I was quite disappointed with my evening at Truth. Instead of giving a play-by-play of events- I'd rather list pros and cons.Pros: 1) They have very reasonable prices. This is a good option if you're on a budget but still want to dine out.2) No parking issue. You should be able to find plenty of parking without having to bend the block numerous times. There's also plenty of parking on residential streets.Cons:1) Limited menu items: Often times when I dine in restaurants with a limited menu- the food is very good and quite memorable. Unfortunately none of the food we ordered was worth a return visit. Suggestion- create a good wine listing insert for your menu. Most Italian restaurants have great wine options to complement the cuisine. I would suggest a minimum of 12-15 strong options, w/ regions ranging from Chile to of course Italy. Also- some Italian dessert options would be great (I.e. gelato, tiramisu, various pastries) and coffee (I.e. cappuccino and espresso) is strongly advised.2) No order: I was very pleased to see a full house when I visited, but was disappointed that we had to stand in the doorway and wait to spot someone to seat us. The waitress they had on duty was not good. The owner of the establishment did a great job in assisting her server. Suggestion- please hire a hostess to meet and greet patrons upon their arrival, coat check if needed, and provide seating. I think 2 servers should be on hand to provide accurate and prompt service. I'd like to see the owner suited and booted, and out on the floor mingling and thanking patrons. Although a real boss has to be ready to roll up their sleeves at any given moment- it would've been nice to see the boss looking like an owner rather than a waitress. Also- don't bother taking reservations. I made an 8:30PM reservation, but it was not referenced when we were finally greeted. I didn't even see a reservation book on hand.3) It's a sports bar: The establishment is a sports bar that features Italian cuisine. If you're looking for fine Italian dining that offers traditional restaurant decor- this is not the place for you. We counted 8 flat screens TV's (one including a 65inch). The bar occupies the bulk of this small establishment. In fact- the first thing our waitress asked was \"what would we like to drink?\" We had to request water half way through our meal. I really hope Truth does well. Well enough to open a second location that is a traditional restaurant that offers more upscale Italian cuisine.", "Went with a friend for dinner and, overall, I think this would be a good place to come for drinks and apps and watch the Bulls or Bears, but I wouldn't return for dinner. \u00a0On the plus side, there was prompt, friendly service, plenty of free street parking, nice bar area with plenty of comfortable stools. \u00a0The place is small and they have about 10 Tvs all on the same channel at a high volume so it's great to hear the game, but the TV, in combination with the music they also have going makes it challenging to have a conversation. So, that's a plus for the sports bar, downside for the restaurant vibe or romantic night out. \u00a0There are a variety of items on the menu, but when we were there, several items were not available due to some issue in the kitchen. This was disappointing, but can happen anywhere. The portion size is good, food well presented, and the price point fair. \u00a0I had the shrimp which was fabulous. \u00a0My friend had penne pasta which was just OK. \u00a0It seems they are trying to be both a sports bar and an Italian restaurant , but in such a small space, I don't think it works that well for the restaurant patrons.", "Great place the staffed friendly. Food is delicious. The HD TVs are great for watching the game. You can also rent the place for private events. Yelp will get 2 stars for making write a book about a place!!!", "I have tried several entr\u00e9e and main courses each were superb. Unsurpassed atmosphere and their staff is very attentive with each patron. I have become a regular customer.", "When I Say A MUST TRY .!!!!! I Mean That !

Very Proud Of This Place Simply Amazing", "Truth is a nice addition to Bronzeville. I drove past the place a few times and didn't realize it was a restaurant or even an Italian restaurant until a neighbor mentioned it. The signage out front is not particularly clear and I incorrectly assumed it was a hair salon. The atmosphere was lively and festive when we went. It had more of a lounge/bar feel than restaurant but I liked the vibe. It's a nice space that's well designed. The waitress and owner, who stopped by our table to say hello, were very friendly. It seemed like the waitress was new because she didn't do the small things a pro does like checking if there was anything else we wanted to order before walking away (we did and one person hadn't even ordered anything) and asking if we wanted another drink when finished with the first. No big deal but we needed to speak up. It wasn't awkward because she was friendly and nice. The food was good but not outstanding. I'm going to skip the calamari next time. It was a good meal and good experience overall so we will be back.", "The service was mediocre and the food is below average. The food has poor presentation and does not come timely. This is not the place to come for dinner ...it serves the purpose if you're hungry but misses the mark of excellence. From a service perspective there is a lack of accountability.The space is beautiful and centrally located and that's the plus.", "The ambiance of the place is outstanding. Very welcoming. The food was great. I had the pasta with the spicy marinara sauce. I also added the turkey sausage on the side. Delicious!! The waitress was very kind and answered all questions. I would come again. They have big screen TVs, if you enjoy watching games. Very clean.", "The Atmosphere was very pleasant, and the food was Amazing. My party had Calamari, Salmon, party wings and Chicken Penne Pasta. Owner and waitress were very welcoming. Will be returning soon.", "I was here on a Wednesday evening; so it was full but not busy. The bartender was very slow, but service was friendly and personable. I had fish tacos and they were pretty good. The music is nice and atmosphere is mature and relaxed. I wish this place had opened before I moved to the burbs. I would like to come back and try a few more food items, all in all its a nice place. I'm hoping that at some point very soon, they get an additional bartender and server. I love that the Bronzeville area has a great lounge like this, such a welcomed addition!", "The food was great, however it took too long to receive \u00a0items such as bread, and ended up eating and paying before receiving what we asked for. Not too fond of the owner massaging myself and my man during the table visit either. There are ways to make guests feel welcomed without invading personal space and unwanted or requested touching.

The scramblers were huge portions, full of fresh vegetables, and the accompanying salsa was surprisingly tasty. I opted out of the bread sides and got an overflowing side of fruit that was deliciously ripe. I managed to steal several bites of the pancakes that were super light and fluffy. The pancakes themselves tasted like plain white bread, but add a little bit of butter and syrup for that magical sweet and salty combination. It's just a simple place serving up some good ol' breakfast food with fast and friendly service.", "this place has serious breakfast ! The major downside is the waiting ! It took a while to order our food and to get it . It is a busy breakfast place so just be prepared to wait I guess . To the food !!

I usually eat the rest the next day because I'm usually stuffed for the rest of the day! Prices can't be beat.A bit finicky with credit card splitting (I believe they only do two cards/table).

I was so turned off that she stayed on her obviously personal phone call while seating us. She placed the menus on the table and walked away, still without greeting us. The waitress was better. Because it was pretty early and not much of a crowd, we were in and out pretty quickly. The food was good. I had the veggie quiche (comes with fruit and delicious hash browns). My bf had the meat lovers special. His pancakes were so fluffy and yummy! It's an average spot with decent food. I'll come again. Hopefully the hostess puts the phone down long enough to greet us next time.", "I visit this spot at least once a week.

But I got mine with wheat toast and the boyfriend got the buttermilk pancakes. I also got a side of grits. It was so good!!! a little too spicy for me but amaze balls. It even comes with their homemade salsa that was so flavorful and a little spicy too. The southwestern skillet comes with sausage, potatoes veggies, and you get two eggs on top.

Good thing because we came hungry.They've got plenty of the usual offerings, plus some gluten-free and vegetarian options as well - which was perfect for my friend whose a vegetarian (well, almost). I ordered the create-your-own skillet which allows you four veggies/meats/cheese (whatever your preference) and then each additional is extra charge. That skillet was huge (bacon, eggs, spinach, onions, tomatoes, cheddar cheese). Then they serve you three buttermilk pancakes with.

I love love love that their syrup is always warm when they give it to you....why don't all breakfast places do that? From the time I sit down, to the time I get my food and eat, this takes no more than 30 minutes every time whether I'm by myself or with 4-5 people. Beware of weekend mornings bc it gets extremely packed. I knocked them one star bc they need a larger waiting area (especially on weekends when it gets packed in there). They recently moved to a new and larger location, so no reason why the waiting area should still be the same size as their old location. They also need a new process for their waiting list. For years they hand you a number and call it when your table is ready. It's 2015 and time to update this process. Other then that love it!!!!", "The food & service was delicious.

Nicole told me that the syrup is house made and includes molasses as an ingredient. Personally, I think molasses goes very well with pancakes without being diluted by other ingredients.I liked my scrambler. The husband liked his baked omelette. \u00a0He told me the pancakes were too doughy, as if undercooked. \u00a0I must agree with his assessment.The restaurant itself is very comfortable, and the tables are NOT crowded together, which is nice and kept the noise down.

Wow, it was tremendous.- I mean magnificent. \u00a0Vegan sampler plate (in my featured pic - the center is some sort of cabbage, not meat), .. and hot spicy red sauce shrimp dish w salad later -- I was so wowed by the taste.Side note : As an Integrative Nutritionista, who is also an environmentalist and an animal advocate - I have recently merged from a many year Pescatarian / Vegetarian to Vegan. \u00a0The second plate of food, for whom I was dining with, did include shrimp. \u00a0I inquired about whether it was Wild Caught, .. or Farm Raised. \u00a0The sweet gentleman preferred to defer to the sweet woman,- who had no idea. \u00a0So, likely farm raised everything. \u00a0Fyi.- for people who may know or feel enough to care.Bless these sweetheart people.- who accidentally put my dine-in order as a take out, so I ended waiting over an hour. \u00a0And forgot my drinks (but had it on my tab, despite me sweetly mentioning to remember I never received them, I didn't want them to-go, and to please remember to not charge), and negated to check on me for hot water refill or more napkins (although happily brought when I stopped them to ask).I typically never get poor service.- but this wasn't actually poor (the personality / disposition of the man and woman who may possibly have been the owners (?) - was nice enough and polite).- just super - um forgetful.?. \u00a0And not due to the place being busy or anything. - kinda strange.And I even more so don't typically talk / write / review about poor experiences. \u00a0But the food was so so good, and delicious, - and I loved to be able to eat African (Senegalese) while remaining Vegan -- I feel a Yelp Review is warranted. \u00a0Wish I could do another half star to make a 3.5 out of 5.Good luck.And enjoy.", "Good was nice. Disappointed with the fact that is ordered lamb and got chicken instead. But the friendly customer service made up for that..they were very greatly apologetic.", "Mush have: yassa lamb with djolof rice. \u00a0Big cut of lamb accompanied by a sauce of raisins, onions, and olives. Spicy and tart and savory and sweet in one bite. \u00a0Djolof rice are a must have- tasty, but i think flavored with red palm oil (and pretty oily).The food here was very tasty, and good value for the dollar ($14 entree and I brought home leftovers enough for next day lunch.)But the SERVICE! Our party of 6 was one of two occupied tables and it took us two hours to get through dinner. \u00a0I think the server had pity on us, because he came over with drink samples (if you get a drink, go with the honeydew pineapple). The entrees also came out at different times, so the first person's entree had been sitting for 10 minutes before everyone at the table got their food. \u00a0Made for an awkward birthday dinner. The server didn't write down any of our orders, and my entree came with the incorrect side.Do not recommend the thiakry. This dessert has the taste of a sweetened creme fraiche, but the steamed millet inside was a strange textural element for me- it reminded me of grape nuts in a good vanilla yogurt. (caveat- I don't have an experience palate for African dessert dishes.)Bottom line- with the experience to try a Senegalese food and support a Bronzeville institution, but not a great dining experience overall.", "Good sauces but such overcooked meat! Our favorite by far was the maffa (peanut butter stew with lamb), with sides of djolof rice and plantains. We also had the yassa chicken and the curry lamb. The curry lamb came with a steak knife and we still struggled to cut it. The chicken was cooked similar to tandoori chicken but I still found it on the dry side. All meats are bone-in and have large chunks of fat on the lamb, which made it difficult to share. As other reviews have said, the wait time for the food is quite long even if you're the only person in the restaurant. I would consider returning for the maffa, but sort of doubt I'll actually wind up making a return trip.", "I ordered the Red Snapper/cabbage and salmon patties. \u00a0 OMG, IT WAS WORTH the wait.", "This is a welcoming restaurant with friendly staff who are willing to help guide food choices so you are very happy with your meal. The food is outstanding, especially to those who are adventurous foodies who want to try different cuisines. \u00a0We had the Maffe, Saka Saka, Sauce Graine and Sauteed Shrimp with Green Peppers and Onions. \u00a0We split Fataya for an appetizer. \u00a0Everything we had was tasty and unique. \u00a0The Maffe stood out in flavor! \u00a0Very reasonable prices. \u00a0Take your time here for a memorable experience! \u00a0Don't miss the wonderful drinks! \u00a0Thank you for your hospitality, Yassa! \u00a0Keep up the great work!", "I had a really great Sunday lunch here with two other friends, and this was their introduction to West African/Senegalese food so I was excited to bring them here- we all left really full (with boxed leftovers) and pleased with our food. If you have never had West African or Senegalese before, you should definitely check this place out!In undergrad I studied abroad in Senegal and now once in a while, I would really want some fried plantains, Yassa chicken and jollof rice. This place was spot on and they had kind, attentive service. So I was glad I stumbled upon this place during one of my Yelp searches.When our server first came I said a Wolof greeting, \"Nnanga def?\" Like, how's it going? The response is: \"Maangi fi\" = \"I am here\" and there was another greeting/exchange about peace. I was getting nostalgic about those sweltering hot days in Dakar (the capital), and the server told me he is actually from Togo, but had studied at the Cheikh Anta Diop in Dakar. Cool.Two of us ordered the Yassa Chicken [$12.00/order] (I got a half:half side of white rice and jollof rice. My friend got a side of half:half jollof rice and plantains). My friend's boyfriend got the Yassa Lamb [$14.00] which was tender and delicious and also had the half:half jollof rice and white rice sides.I also ordered a Bissap drink (which is a hibiscus drink, tangy and sweet at the same time, served cold). For the Yassa Chicken, it was a huge portion (1/2 chicken) with those amazing stir-fried mustard-y/caramelized minced onions and your sides. For the Yassa Lamb, you get a large portion of tender, marinated meat. My friends loved the strong/spiced flavors of the meat, the rice, the sweetness of the plantains. They loved the variety of tastes from a single dish that you can get in one bite.Since we all did the half:half sides, each side was an additional 50 cents. I'd have to say, the plantains and the jollof rice was the best combination of sides. The plantains were served piping hot, and next time I'd get an additional side of this on its own. If you dine here, be sure to also ask for a side of spicy chili sauce - it gives everything a nice fiery kick.Come here for big portions of Senegalese food and you won't be disappointed! The chicken was charred and a little dry, but nothing that took away from the flavor. Next time I'd get the Yassa Lamb or try the House Tiebu Djeun, which is whole tilapia with cabbage, carrot and yucca, served over jollof rice - I had Tiebu Djeun almost daily when I was with my host family in Dakar. \u00a0Their lunch menu is definitely well-priced based on the heaping amount of food that you get. Whether it's your first time eating Senegalese food or you're nostalgically craving it, Yassa African won't let you down.", "Came here on a Sunday around 4pm and wasn't packed at all but got kinda busy as time went on. We Ordered the salmon patty which was great but I don't like onions so I had to pass (onions were inside the patty). I ordered the chopped chicken with jollof rice. Friend ordered the fish with plantains. Food seemed like it took forever to get to us but I guess they made everything from stretch. The jollof rice was great. Tasted like nigerian jollof to me so I didn't see a difference. The chicken was to fatty for my liking but that's just me. They had an onion bases \"sauce\" on the side which was surprising good due to the fact that I hate onions. Food was good overall but I'm nigerian so I have a bias for my own food being better. Decent price and good for groups I would say. Just wish they had a way to keep the cold from getting in or at least had some type of heater. I want to give this place 3 stars but my date really loved the food. Service was okay. A little bit lacking", "Super friendly service~ we got free samples of all the drinks of their own volition! The ginger drink was POTENT, the hibiscus one was predictably flowery sweet, the baobab one tasted... healthy? But the best by far was the pineapple melon. While selecting an eponymous item is usually a good idea, I would say the best item on the menu was the curry. :) We had a decent sized group and everyone tried something different, which was cool~ the plantains were also good! There were two desserts on the menu, one of which was caramel cake. We did not try the caramel cake, but we did try the other one... and I wouldn't again. As Sarah S. put it, \"This tastes like sweetened creme fraiche soaked grape nuts.\" So unless that's your jam...", "After numerous reviews for Yassa over the years from Check-Please to The Reader, I finally had a chance to come here. \u00a0We organized a dinner for a birthday with 15 people ( all of whom arrived at various times!) \u00a0The service was very friendly and accommodating. \u00a0 Being with a large group, I had an opportunity to try a taste of numerous menu offerings. \u00a0Many things are cooked to order, while others are braised stews which must be cooked in advance to tenderize the protein. \u00a0Like other Yelpers mentioned, it might take a minute to get your food. \u00a0For those who are new to African cuisine, be ready for some different flavor combinations . \u00a0And yes, some of the meat dishes and the whole fish have bones. (Anybody know of a whole fish that ain't got bones?) \u00a0So don't be hating Senegalese cuisine cause some of the dishes area served with meat on the bones! \u00a0Just use your knife to cut it off, OK? \u00a0And in the case of a whole fish, I bet both your moms and your granny would let you use your fingers to get some of the little morsels of flesh from between the bones! I ordered the whole grilled red snapper with djolof rice. \u00a0My fish was a little overcooked, but 3 other folks in our group ordered it, and theirs were tender and flaky. The rice was really delicious, as were the plantains and yucca that I tasted ( off other people's plates). \u00a0They were out of dibi lamb, so I gangstered a taste of one of my friend's Maffe. (Delicious stew of lamb cooked in a peanut sauce.) \u00a0Yassa is a \"ma & pops\" kind of place. \u00a0It gave off the same kind of vibe I experienced while traveling in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, & Nigeria. Nothing fancy. \u00a0Just good home cooking. \u00a0It's a keeper. Oh yeh....it's a BYO.", "I'm hoping future visits work out better because, not only is this place a quick walk from my house, it does have a lot going for it. They're friendly, however the service is a little slow, prices are good and portions aren't bad. A bit heavy on the carbs and the meat on the lighter side. Speaking of meat, their online menu has beef brochette on it, but the menu we got didn't have it on there. One of the great things about the internet is being able to look at menus and decide ahead of time, so I had it planned out before I walked in the door, this is what I want! I did opt for the chicken, and will say maybe they were slow because they were cooking the moisture out of the bird, good but chewy. The combination of spices on everything else wasoutstanding. We'll definitely go back, and I hope to be adding stars.", "\"Well it was ok.\" That's my response whenever someone asks me about my food from Yassa. My boyfriend and I decided to try them out last Saturday and me being me I said cool. Walked in, sat right down because the place was half full. It's a family friendly restaurant where the servers were very friendly and responsive. We never had to ask for more water( that's being attentive and ice cold by the way) and the restaurant was very clean. He ordered the Yassa fish...Tilapia fillet with djolof \u00a0rice. I ordered the brochette chicken with cabbage. My chicken was perfectly cooked and seasoned. My cabbage needed more salt or herbs but it was cooked well. I didn't eat the onion relish they serve with it because I don't like olives. His fish dish was very well seasoned and tasty but the fish seemed dry. Kinda like frozen fish fillets which are always a no no. His fish had a vegetable mixture on top of the rice which was good but the same olive onion relish that my dish came with too. Oh we also ordered the Fataya patties which were salmon, spices, onion and tomato paste stuffed in a sweet pastry dough and fried. It was ok. I'm willing to try Yassa again because the lamb looked amazing. Everyone raves about the Yassa fish which I can't do because of the fish head. Try them out and see what you think.", "Searched all over for cassava leaf for my boyfriend who lived in Sierra Leone for peace corps and we finally found it here! He said he really enjoyed it- I thought it tasted pretty delicious even though I had no idea what it was supposed to taste like. I had the snapper, it was pretty pricey considering, but was very delicious and they do have other kinds of fish for cheaper options. I also highly recommend either the sorrel or ginger drink.", "I \u00a0just totally LOOOVE the new location.I had already visited their previous spot on the southeast side.Food is still fantastic.One of my top picks for African cuisine in Chicago.This new location is so much nicer and way more accessible to me.Means I'll have the opportunity to dine here more often since I go hang out at the lakefront so often.Service is really good.Always has been.They really did a great job with the decor.I just love it.Im so glad they relocated.Hopefully I can convince friends and family to try West African/Senegalese cuisine and point them here.Im sure they'll become fans as well!!! I will return!!!", "Today is a full house. Only 1 table left. Good aromas fill my nostrils as I walked in and was seated. Nice staff, super friendly, and busy. The window seats are filled with one birthday party group, \u00a0and the long tables pushed together near the back hold the second birthday party of 7. A baby's first birthday being celebrated by her parents and their friends. 8 other groups fill the tables, plus my table. The staff is bringing orders as fast as they can, and everyone is happy, smiling, and eating good food. This is a BYOB restaurant. Yet the main thing I see being poured is the house juices, Ginger, and the purple color Bissop herb. Both are excellent drinks, made fresh on site daily, and they are good.Today I ordered the Lamb dinner.Charbroiled, \u00a0tender, seasoned just right. With veggies and rice, and a big glass of fresh Ginger juice.Man it's gonna take me some time to eat all this food. I might have to get a take out tray, AGAIN.

I then went and got some very good chicken dish that was amazing (I don't say that often). I was in my old stomping ground of Bronzeville recently and decided it would be good to stop by the actual location finally. I walked in before the after work dinner crowd made it in so there were only a few tables occupied as the TV ran the local news. Jackie was my server and was very helpful with helping me choose the perfect dish. I decided on the Maffe which is cubes of lamb cooked in creamy peanut butter and tomato sauce with potatoes, yams and carrots; served over white rice. I also got a side of carrots and cabbage. This dish was amazing as the lamb with the sauce was out of this world! There was so much sauce left over I ate it by the spoonful...couldnt help myself or let it go to waste. I can actually say I did the damn thang on that meal! A patron at another table said he was wondering when my eyes would roll to the back of my head and he saw the moment it happened. He even told me other dishes I should try when I return. Yes, there will be multiple returns!", "Honest to God the best food Ive had in a LONG time. I got the djulof rice with fish. WOO!

And plus, it took forever for me to get the food like I have to say I waited half an hour for my goddamn food to be ready. When I got the food, it looked unappetitizing. It looked like a complete mess because the bread, chicken, and fries were smothered with all the damn sauce! Yuck! I wasn't expecting that at all! I thought the lady would put the sauce on the side, but she didn't! I really didn't enjoy the food and didn't finish it, so I threw it away. It was so disappointing. It was a waste of my $10! WTF! I wish I got my refund back because, again, the food was so disgusting. That location is so ghetto, I won't step my foot there ever again.

But so what? There's a lot of people there for a reason, and that reason is: Their chicken is the shiz. And it's cooked fresh, which is why you wait.They've got a $5 minimum on credit/debit, so I always get a 1-liter of pop with it to make up for that. But I get a delicious, FILLING meal with a big drink for a little over $5, it really can't be beat!The staff isn't overly friendly, pretty no-nonsense \"Give me your order and GTFO\" and it's hard to hear when your number is called...but all the negatives, in my opinion, are outweighed by the deliciousness and the affordability of this place.", "Well, I waited two days to eat here. I wanted to see what all the hype was about. After 1.5 days on a clear liquid diet I was ready to put in some work on some fried chicken. 1. It really is a shack.2.

No ma'am. Not today. NOT! TODAY!5. When I FINALLY opened my bag o chicken, it had hot sauce ALL OVER EVERYTHING. Smh! That's like asking for A1 steak sauce to put on your filet!

On top of that, every order of fries is massive. I ordered a medium, and what I got looked like it should have been a large. Everything is about value here, and I was very pleased.The salt and pepper flavor for the chicken is great. If you ask for sauce, I think they tend to put too much, and it overpowers the other flavors. Also, if you ask for sauce on your fries, it makes them soggy. Whatever way you put it, this place has great chicken for an even greater price. It's not the best chicken, but I would definitely take it at such a low price.", "It took a while for our 15pc wings to come out even though there were only three other people waiting at the time. The chicken was all right, some wings were doused in their hot sauce (which isn't hot at all) while others had none at all.

All for $3.50! I ordered my chicken with Hot Sauce and Salt & Pepper. But despite this \"great\" deal, really reconsider this dietary decision before you head over to this famous South-side institution.

I've lived in the neighborhood on and off for almost 5 years and you would think this establishment would get better with time and under new management but it hasn't. The quality of the mild sauce has been watered down to some type of barbecue sauce And on today my best friend from out of town wanted to order from there today. There were two separate orders and I asked for a plastic bag to carry and the lady tells me it's .05! I've been to other establishments and never have they asked me for a dime for a bag. So a guy comes from the back and says \"ITS ON THE MENU\" Immediately turned off from that.Upon going home I noticed the sauce was not on the chicken. I called back to let them know that I specially said to make sure the sauce is on the chicken. The woman tells me \"you should've checked your receipt\" I asked her your cashier only pointed out the number to be called and I didn't look at the receipt because I thought she heard me loud in clear speaking through the plastic whole.

That being said, it seems like they always have my order ready super fast if I call in compared to if I just walk in but that might just be my bias. I tend to wait less than 10 minutes for my single order but I imagine for large orders the wait could easily be 20 minutes.The place is a bit ratty, there are only four tables, \u00a0around dinner time, parking can be hard to find, and I'm pretty sure there are no restrooms (there is a door marked \"MEN\" down a dark and narrow hallway by the vending machines but there are gumball machines blocking the hall.

Theirs is a plain bun that is very airy and doesn't hold up well to the large amounts of ingredients or the liquids from those (pickle, relish, and tomato mainly).They did a great job cooking the dog itself and it had a little char to it which was tasty and the other ingredients were all tasty but I thought the relish was just okay and I didn't get any celery salt to my knowledge.The fries that come with it were also a little undercooked in my opinion (I like them darkened a bit and with some crunch/not soggy).The place itself was nice and clean and the service was pretty fast and very friendly.", "Chicago is looking for the successor to Hot Dougs, and not only is H-Dogs a candidate, I think it's even better, because they make the single best salmon sandwich I have had anywhere!

It was a perfectly grilled salmon filet with crisp greens, red onions, and a zesty horseradish infused dressing, all on a wheat bun.I also sampled the Greek, vegetarian and French dogs. The Greek was essentially a gyro, with lamb, tomatoes, onions and a their version of \"tzatzki\" sauce. The Healthy Hound is a vegetarian dog that's a bit more in the style of a Chicago dog, but without the pickle, and with roasted peppers. The French was the richest dog I tried, duck sausage smothered in caramelized onions.All the dogs were good, but I kept going back to that salmon burger!Everything comes with excellent French fries, served crisp and piping hot. The inclusion of fries makes the pricing of the dogs and burgers much more attractive.There's also a rich chili, available in both vegetarian and turkey versions.

Bring your wallet and prepare for happiness.Healthy Hound:A veggie dog that comes awfully close to regular hot dog, meaning you can fool some people. Otherwise, great taste.Greektown Dog:Fantastic!

One of the employees did apologize for the delay but still... #wowI visited H-Dogs one time years ago when they first opened. I ordered a hot dog and remember being underwhelmed. The bun was hard and the dog just wasn't good. Thus the reason I hadn't returned until now, some 2-3 years later.Well, after all of that I must say that H-Dogs was worth the wait. It definitely wasn't the mediocre food that I recall having back in the day. I got a Nick & Nate burger (regular burger w/tomato, lettuce, mustard, ketchup, onion, and pickles) The burger was delicious! It was a generous size and very tasty. It came with a small amount of fries that were hot, fresh and yummy. At first I thought the portion size could have been larger but halfway during the meal I was full. Turns out the amount of fries was perfect.I'm sorry that I didn't give H-Dogs a another try long before now. I can't wait to go back and try something else on the menu.Five dollars for a burger and fries (no drink) isn't bad.

You def filled a void in Bronzeville. I'll admit, it took me a minute to try yall. I noticed there was never a crowd in here. Now I see why...Chicago Dog- Unlike any Chicago dog that I've ever tasted in that- its nasty! The hot dog itself seems to be low sodium? Its been char grilled and then placed in a paper bag to sweat the char off before serving? Notice the question marks because I'm that puzzled. I just don't understand the wrinkled appearance and soggy texture, so pardon me, I'm trying to make sense of it all...H Dog- Totally my fault. I missed the part in the description where it explains that its made with *turkey chilli. I hate turkey products when cooked a certain way. The turkey in this chilli happened to be cooked the way that I hate. The chilli itself also lacks flavor and is too watery to be placed atop of a hot dog, so the bun disintegrates into a gloppy mess. Bronzeville Belly Buster- The burger seems frozen. It seemed like a patty you could get at any Jewel or Save A Lot, which would have been fine if it had any flavor. Just an over sized unappetizing burger.Truffle fries- Despite our 30 minute wait in a completely empty restaurant on a Friday night- for hotdogs and a burger, we still managed to get cold, stale, bitter tasting fries. I live literally 1 minute away. There is no way my fries should have been ice cold. The fries tasted like they had been cooked hours before. They were so hard. The truffle oil used does not seem to be of quality. The Customer Service was exceptional, had to add a star for that.

My other side was spaghetti which I enjoyed too. My dinner came with the option of a muffin or biscuit. I ordered a biscuit and received 2 plus jelly! I was more than impressed and can't wait to go back to try their other dishes.", "I can't believe I have not reviewed this stalwart of Chicago eateries before now. If you have a hankering for comfort food, have a discerning palate and your own preferred cook is off-duty, head over to Ms. Lee's. You won't be sorry.Probably best restaurant in Chicago at the moment specializing in Southern cuisine, better known here as Soul Food.Street parking is extremely limited on Sundays, so be prepared.Order by phone if you can or get ready to wait.Only take-out.Menu-by-day offerings only. If you desire smothered chicken on Sunday, and it's not on the menu, come back on the assigned day.The food is consistently great. As close to delicious homemade as one will find. Fresh, not overly seasoned, consistent. I can say this after 10 years of patronage.You can check out the reviews for odes to the standards, e.g., fried chicken, smothered chops, the DRESSING (aaaaahhhh, that DRESSING and not stuffing), fresh potato salad and cobblers. However, the real treat is the occasional gumbo Ms. Lee lovingly prepares. As a gumbo fan, when I don't get homemade, I will venture out to sample around town. Trust me on this: if you know homemade gumbo - especially as it is typically prepared by Louisiana (Creole) descendants - you will be hard-pressed to find one better than Ms. Lee's in any local eatery. That includes ANY of the fancy and/or big name spots downtown or on the north side. I welcome anyone to compare and get back to me on their findings. Ms. Lee does it around Easter and while costly ($30), it is the real deal. Crab, shrimp, oysters ... It's fantastic!This is a place I take out-of-town visitors who want Southern cuisine. Again, it's take-out but not once has anyone been short of praise. When they return to Chicago, Ms. Lee's is automatically on the itinerary. Seriously!Don't be surprised at who you see, especially on Sundays, as Ms. Lee's delectable dishes are only part of the draw. As a star veteran of the city's restaurant community, she is dearly admired on Chicago's South Side. Just as with predecessor, the formerly great Gladys', celebrities and notable others come from near and far. Ms. Lee, with her silver halo framing her always ready charming smile and big greeting is a looker, too!I can't say enough about Ms. Lee's. I appreciate the fact that she has remained loyal to the South Side when clearly she could be elsewhere, probably making more money. She employs a capable, fast and service-oriented team. The food is always on point to-the-crumb. She and her eatery are the stuff of legends.", "Miss Lee's Good Food...IS GOOD!!!...

They also have a jungle juice Miss Lee let a couple of people in the waiting area taste. That was good as well. Miss Lee gets much respect from me.

Back when I commuted between Hyde Park to the Southwest Side as a teacher, I'd jump off the 55 at Indiana to get some Miss Lee's when I didn't know where dinner would otherwise come from. Now that I'm a student at the university and am constantly surrounded by other students terrified of the greater South Side, my Miss Lee's consumption has tapered off.The food is absolutely terrific. Hands down, it's the best soul food I've found on this green earth. Recalling the pickled beets nearly brings tears to my eyes. But generally, I haven't yet ordered something that wasn't delicious.Logistically, it's one of the more difficult things. If you order in person, expect to wait a long time (20-30 minutes maybe).

Great portions, good prices, and good service. They don't have seating, so it's only carry out and delivery. The lot is also small and can get full at times. Oh and I know that's lots of places have them now, but their smoothies are awesome. Pineapple coconut FTW!", "I ordered from here once. I ordered sesame chicken and fried rice. The sesame chicken tasted pretty good, but the coating had the weirdest freaking texture... like it was 100 years old. It was chalky and seemed to be falling apart. Even though the taste was good, I would not risk ordering again due to the texture... it was just that strange. The fried rice was good, but had too much soy sauce.Better than Wok N Roll, so I'll give it two stars.", "An extremely enthusiastic five stars!!!It's been so hard to find good cheap Chinese food in the HP area and I think Little Wok takes the cake and runs with it. If you go with the dinner specials, it's $6 for pop, egg roll, fried rice, and one of the entree meats/vegetables. The portions are gargantuan. I think it tastes great - just like the Chinese takeout gods intended.Downside - you can't get diet coke as your pop apparently.", "I keep giving this place chance after chance, yesterday was the last time I would ever order food from little wok. I ordered chicken and broccoli and it taste spoiled I sent that back and ordered the chicken fried rice instead that was worst. The only thing thats 80% consistent is there smoothies. IM DONE WITH LITTLE WOK!", "I definitely don't believe this should get under a 3 star review. Yes, the delivery took a while but come on they're bringing it to you. Pick up is only 15 minutes. The driver was more than courteous and the online system is super efficient and remembers your previous orders. I haven't had anything bad from here from the 3 times i've tried it now and it's very reasonably priced.", "My girlfriend and I have been loyal Little Wok customers for going on three years now, and hope to continue enjoying their delicious food and friendly service for many years to come. Hyde Park is sparse on good takeout, but if you're feeling lazy one night, Little Wok promptly delivers an awesome variety of hot and tasty food at very reasonable prices. While their egg rolls leave much to be desired, their shrimp fried rice is great, as is their Mongolian Beef (super good!) and Kung Pao Chicken. Their Egg Foo Young is tasty and healthy, if a little on the bland side. I get it when I'm not feeling like having deliciously greasy beef or chicken. \u00a0You can sub out the fried rice for white rice if you want to mix it with the sauce or cut down on the calories. I can't imagine spending over $20 there for a dinner for two. The Yelper who paid a 26 dollar bill must have read the menu wrong. We spend $18 including a generous tip and delivery for dinner (get the Dinner Specials, they are huge and delicious, and also come with a soft drink and an eggroll). Mr. Smiles, aka the Bald Man, aka the delivery dude that works there is sweet and very fast. He loves speaking Chinese to you, as my GF will attest, and though you may wonder at what he says, let me assure you, he is not laughing at you, but rather is laughing with you. I may be biased because I just had a dinner from them and I am descending into a warm food coma, but really, give them a try, order from the Dinner Special Menu, and you won't be disappointed. Just don't go pick it up, the location is in a middle of a rougher part of town.", "I had the orange chicken from here is was ok. Not the best at all. The crab Rangoon was very delicious.

Bizarre. \u00a0The broccoli was so soggy that my boyfriend accidentally cut a piece of broccoli in half with his chopsticks!!! \u00a0I'm thinking they might have used frozen broccoli and that's just wrong. \u00a0The eggrolls were soggy, too. \u00a0I realize it's delivery and fried food doesn't travel well, but other places mange to deliver half decent eggrolls. \u00a0I guess no flavor is better than something gross. \u00a0The food is edible--you probably won't die from eating it. \u00a0My frugal boyfriend is eating leftovers all week, but I refuse to eat something that unhealthy that doesn't at least taste yummy. \u00a0I heated up my leftover black-eyed peas & collard greens from new years, because I am a better cook than the \"chefs\" at Little Wok. \u00a0I'll give 5 stars to Mr. Smiles, the guy who actually delivered the food. \u00a0He had a huge grin on his face and was very friendly...on second thought, maybe he was just laughing at me for paying 26 dollars for that crap.", "Anyone in my area knows there isn't much to eat in the Washington Park area. \u00a0Great food and friendly staff!", "Not a fan after just one try. \u00a0I swear the pot-stickers were stuffed with catfood. \u00a0Maybe it was just a bad night for them, but I am not going to take another gamble. \u00a0 I found De Rice and this will forever be my Hyde Park Chinese Food provider.JD"], "rest_types": ["Chinese"], "price_range": "Under $10", "score": 2.5, "name": "Little Wok"}, "kiCVprRpJ2UBvOrdck9akA": {"long": -87.5847875008758, "lat": 41.7951091813566, "price_index": "$$", "hours": {"Mon": {"open": "Closed", "close": "Closed"}, "Wed": {"open": "11:00 am", "close": "10:00 pm"}, "Tue": {"open": "11:00 am", "close": "10:00 pm"}, "Thu": {"open": "11:00 am", "close": "10:00 pm"}, "Fri": {"open": "11:00 am", "close": "10:00 pm"}, "Sat": {"open": "11:00 am", "close": "10:00 pm"}, "Sun": {"open": "11:00 am", "close": "10:00 pm"}}, "comments": ["Another fan here.

This was my go to place in the neighborhood to take people when they visited, order takeout, go with groups of friends, and just generally eat whenever I had the chance. The prices are decent and the service/staff is excellent. Never had a bad experience, never had a dish that wasn't fresh and well prepared, never had a long wait for a dish, never really had a complaint. Having literally eaten this food either in the restaurant or at a University event at least 100x, the consistency really stands out in hindsight. My go to dishes from each section are the Crab Rangoons, Bangkok Chicken and the Mango Ice Cream.The Crab Rangoons are better than those I've had at many other establishments. They are great.But the headline here is the Bangkok Chicken. This is what you should order if chicken is at all your thing. Literally my favorite chicken dish of all time and there isn't a close second. So good and so filling. This would be my death row meal (not that I've killed anyone)--that good. Always perfectly prepared and flavored. Years later friends and I are still tinkering in our own kitchens trying to recreate the unique blend of flavors. No easy task and I don't think we will ever be successful. It is unique. I've gone as far as showing the description to servers at other Thai restaurants and asking if they have anything comparable and they never bring out anything close to this. Love this place. Quintessential Hyde Park simplicity.", "One of the major Thai eateries in Hyde Park, The Snail isn't known for having the best thai food in the world, but it's one of only a few thai eateries in Hyde Park, the prices are good, the customer service is fine, and the food is decent.

I will respect that world and will rate them all differently here. In my mind, the hierarchy is clear, and the Snail is in the middle. But it is good! Just not good enough.The Snail wins when it comes to atmosphere and the fact that you can color on the tables. This point can be a big one when you want to color on tables, which may be often. ;)With the atmosphere in mind, though, Snail also marks up its prices from the clear price collusion happening elsewhere on 55th Street. It's just weird to see the prices of Thai 55 and Siam identical, then Snail marked up. I'll save my 50 cents thank you very much! In general I think the cost is a sign of a greater point: that the Snail takes itself more seriously than the other Thai places.At the same time, though, I've never been inspired by The Snail the way I've been inspired by other Thai food. I've tried new dishes, but never been wowed, never been a convert. It's all just fine.While this can be good sometimes, the atmosphere, the seriousness, this is not what I'm looking for in my 55th street Thai, so I take my money elsewhere.High credit card minimum, so be prepped with cash if you are getting takeout.", "A hyde park staple. You will not find more authentic Thai flavors anywhere in the world outside of Thailand. You will be pleasantly surprised by every dish that's brought out.

This place is just as good as the places I used to go to in the city I moved from that I had discovered over the years. I'm so happy to have found it! The only downside is that they are open less than he other restaurants and do not deliver to The Shoreland.", "Nice size venue with authentic Thai cuisine.

Great place for a quick bite!", "They are very sweet people, once they seat you (quickly I might add) they bring you water and some chips. They are very quick to server you which is great because every time I come here I'm always starving! Food is sooooo good! But my fav is Pad Tai :) it's enough to for 2-3 people. Thai Tea is bomb too. Restaurant is always clean and the bathroom as well :) I ordered their coconut milk banana pudding dessert and it was so yummy! I've never had anything like it before :) I guess they didn't have bananas and I saw the waitress run out of the store and then come back with a fresh batch of bananas. I was thankful they didn't just tell me that they didn't have bananas and that I would have to pick something else. They went out of their way to deliver great service. What more could I ask for?!", "I like this place. Came a while back ago with a group of friends.

But can I really complain too much about anything that comes free? No. My pad Thai (no meat) was pretty tasty, but my brother was less than impressed with his drunken noodles.I very much enjoyed the random assortment of art on the walls.

We ask for a delivery from them at least once every 10 days, not kidding...We really like their curries with duck in general. The red or green duck curry with rice are just delicious. The noodles are ok, nothing special. You can easily find better around. The appetizers are ok as well. I think that their strength is really in the curries. Overall, a good place when you dont feel like cooking.", "Good Thai food. We dropped by here once for lunch and tried some of their soup and the drunken noodles. Both were tasty and the large bowl of soup is very large, plenty to split between two people.", "My partner and I live in the neighborhood and have tried every Thai restaurant on the street (there are 3) and this is by far the worst of them. This isn't because the food is awful but because the service is atrocious. Nonexistent. Twice we have waited 45+ minutes without acknowledgment or water or even a smile. Shame on us for waiting that long, but we have faith in a place surprisingly us with exceptional service beyond one bad night.

The drunken noodle here was not spicy at all - so I was pretty disappointed by that. I did hear the table next to us directly ask for it to be made spicy, so maybe I'll try that next time.Red Curry Fried Rice: On paper, this sounded delicious. It ended up being okay - I feel like they could have used more curry to really enhance the flavor because right now, it just had a weird balance of flavors. But not bad overall.Stir Fried Chicken with Lemon Grass: I had pretty high hopes for this dish, and I was pretty disappointed. The sauce they use is pretty standard.

Other times, the service is almost impossibly slow and the food is disappointing. Unfortunately my recent experiences have been in the latter category. On each of my last two visits, I found myself sitting in a not-so-busy restaurant but, for some reason, could not seem to get noticed by a server. Once someone finally took my order, it was quite a long wait for the food to arrive. On one occasion I got the rib tips - the sauce was good but the meat was of such low quality that it was almost completely inedible. It tasted like I was just chewing on pieces of cooked fat covered in BBQ sauce. On another occasion I got one of the burgers. It was overcooked but fine...just not anything special nor was it worth the wait. While I like the dining space decor (seems controversial on here), I can't stand the huge, hulking wooden boxes on each table containing utensils, sauce, and gigantic rolls of (cheap-seeming) paper towels. The boxes take up a huge amount of space and tend to make the actual eating awkward - especially with multiple people at the table. If you are in Hyde Park and want to get a drink and watch a game, the bar area here is a good place for that. As far as dining though - I probably won't gamble on this place anymore.", "This place is pretty decent, I'd come back again. It wasn't anything to write home about but sometimes all you need is a little, I mean a lotta, barbecue. The ribs were tender, the sauce has a good kick, and the slaw left me wanting more.

The only reason that I even stepped into this restaurant tonight was because the wait at Ja Grill was an hour to get a table.Since I'd never been before, I decided why not, and my friend got us a table.The first table we were seated at was entirely to high for both of us to feel comfortable. It felt like we were sitting in Alice in Wonderland seats after she shrunk. We were pretty quickly allowed to switch tables.....but no one told us it would be the forgotten table.Someone showed up pretty quickly to take our drink orders. The drinks came relatively quickly, so kudos for that. Shortly after the drinks came, I placed my order. Rib tips. They come with coleslaw and fries. Nothing too complicated. My friend was still deciding, so the waitress said she'd come back to take his order in a bit.30 minutes later, she hadn't come back. At this time, no one had been by to refill our water, or even to check on our well being. After about 3 attempts, we were able to flag down someone else to take his order, at which time our original waitress magically appeared at the table to grab the ticket. Like I said. I think we were at the forgotten table.We sat and chatted and sipped our drinks. 30 minutes later....nothing. After trying again for a couple of attempts we managed to flag down a different server to inquire about how much longer we would have to wait for our food to come out. We had been there for over an hour and watched several other tables get their food...but none was headed our way. After the server checked, food magically materialized!! But it was HIS food, not mine. Even though my order was placed 30 minutes before his! How is that even possible?! Seriously?! A new server that we had never seen before went to check and apparently my ticket had fallen out of the ticket line never to be seen again. 3 minutes after this, once again food magically appears. After an hour, I receive an order of rib tips smothered in bbq sauce.I'm no stranger to BBQ houses in Chicago, and of the ones I frequent, the tips are NEVER coated in sauce. When I ordered off of the menu, it said that 3 different sauces to choose from would be present at the table. So when my tips came with sauce already on, I was absolutely done. After I protested, the brand new server quickly removed those tips and came back with more stat. Kudos to her as well....she was the MVP of the moment. And for the record, our table came with one type of BBQ sauce and a container of catsup--not the three different types of sauce the menu promised.For the inconvenience, my friend and I were assured we would get a discount. None was provided. We quickly got to-go boxes, paid our bill, and left. And to add insult to injury.....the food was bland. I prefer my usual BBQ spots, and will never come to this restaurant again. As I looked at other Yelp reviews (after my experience) I saw some people came the same day and had a marvelous experience!! Perhaps we should have been seated at their table. Good luck with this restaurant.", "This place is very tasty! We stayed at the U. Chicago Med Hyatt Place so it was right across the street. I tried the fried ribs; they were tender and fell off the bone. The BBQ sauce on top was finger licking good. I also tried the creamed spinach and cornbread. Both were fabulous (homemade and fresh ingredients). A friend of mine ordered the fried green tomatoes; they were perfect with the dipping sauce. Only complaint is that they are running a yelp special to increase check-ins and will not give the discount on the entire bill, only the food that the person who checked in ordered (mind you we were a large party that spent a couple hundred) even if they are the one fronting everything.

Good fries. Terribly dry, thin, and under - portioned beef brisket. \u00a0Service completely lacking. \u00a0(Dead house, waitress didn't do a single check-in once food was served and took way too long to run the bill because she was chatting with bartender.) \u00a0Also, the decor consists of pig faces painted over traditional artwork.

Ordered pickup because they have some of the foods that I'm favoring in order to shed a few unwanted pounds--believe it or not. On the menu? A hybrid burger of ground pork and ground beef, with caramelized onions and no cheese, a subbed side of baked beans (with an unwanted---an unwarranted in my opinion---$2 upcharge), and another side of green beans. My total bill came to $19, plus a $2 tip. Let's start with the main event. The burger. I requested that it was cooked medium, but it was super well done. Very charred. Very dry. I threw away the bun, the greens and the raw onion, and salvaged the tomato and caramelized onions; topped it with a little bit of mayo and mustard to make up for the desert texture. It was passable. Not for the price, but I wouldn't order it again simply because I wouldn't trust that it wouldn't arrive in the same overdone condition. The green beans were good, and I had a few---saving the rest for tomorrow. The baked beans were sweet, contrasted by some spicy andouille sausage peppered in. The beans were good!

I was not pleased especially for the price, my salad had no flavor the kale was dry. Oh the raw tacos I ( use to) love were horrible.

This is not Allium at Four Seasons where they charge $65 for Dover Sole, which is prepared to perfection. The coleslaw had way too much sauce on it and the cabbage was super sugary and super soggy.

The wings were gross and gamey. It's hard to explain, but these wings did not taste fresh at all. They seemed to be taken out of a freezer bag. Sending them back for a new order was going to be pointless because that is just the nature of their wings. Also someone at the table with me ordered the shrimp small plate and they were unimpressive. They weren't nasty like the wings but did lack any taste or seasoning.

The atmosphere is nice for dining in(plenty of seating with artwork to admire or to purchase) and the service is fast enough for a quick bite to go. Sometimes the line can get lengthy so calling in may be a good idea, but an overall great experience.(i recommend the fire-blazed salad...it's life changing)", "This is one of my favorite places to eat in Hyde Park. Everything I've had on their menu is good. My favorites are the Southwestern and the Jerk Chicken wraps. I also always get a side order of sweet potato fries, which I will say are the best I've ever had. The location itself is a friendly atmosphere. The employees are super nice and attentive. And they also always have a great playlist going. Although Chipotle is just right down the street, Litehouse is the only place that satisfies my burrito/wrap craving. I have ordered from here on GrubHub before too. It was super easy ordering online, and I got my food exactly when the estimated time told me.", "I love going to Hyde Park and this is one of my favorite places to go to. The workers are really friendly and the food is good! On my last visit I had the Jerk Salmon Bowl with spanish rice. So much flavor!!! You can also customize and add whatever items of your choice. I went with adding spinach, spanish rice, veggies, and parmesan cheese. Was really good and the Salmon was fresh.My concious wouldn't let me leave without ordering the sweet potato fries. Some of the best I've ever had and a pretty decent size order. I also made sure to pick up some Loni Loo's candies. They are delcious pecan/pretzel candies covered in either white, milk, or dark chocolate. So glad they are sold here! I always make sure to get a few to last me through the week. Definitely a great place to stop in for lunch or dinner. So far everything I've tried is good :)", "A similar concept to chipotle with way better ingredients, options, and flavor ! \u00a0I always get jerk salmon or tofu as s protein and it is delicious ! I enjoy having fresh spinach and different cheese like feta. \u00a0Their waffle and sweet potato fries are delicious and there are at least 10-12 flavorful sauces/ dressings to accompany your meal. The portions are large bit the food is healthy and light!", "Perfect place for incredible healthy tasty fast food. I have been going here for the last 6 months and I never have been disappointed. The fire blazed salmon is my favorite. It's Very light and tasty.", "My sister put me up on this restaurant and omg \u00a0I had jerk chicken tacos & a jerk tofu salad bowl...it was amazing! The food the serve is high quality, organic ingredients and even offer options like gluten free pizza, fish, diary free cheese and healthy sweet potato fries! The staff is friendly, the guy working the counter has a very cool disposition and made me wanna try whatever they had. This restaurant makes me wanna move to Hyde Park just so I can eat here all the time! Can't wait to go back again...and again...and again!", "Deliciousness.Goodness.RepeatSoo people always talked about this place, but I didn't get it! I do get it now. Fresh foodGood selectionReasonably priced for food you don't feel bad about eating.Great customer service.I've been a few times and haven't been disappointed and always feel content with the portion sizes. To-date, I've had the nachos with chicken and the Mediterranean bowl. Yummy!", "Cannot wait to go back here! I wanted something healthy yet tasty and this place really hit the spot! I was so happy with the Jerk Chicken Salad that I got, it was delicious and spicy and just what I needed to hit the spot. I tried to go here on Friday but there was some open mic night going on so I didn't think they were serving food :( but I'm totally coming back here, its like a much healthier Chipotle if you ask me. They also have vegan and vegetarian options if you need that.", "My first few stops here were phenomenal. Literally bragged to all my friends and family about how much the food was super fresh and fast and the staff was caring and how it seemed like the perfect place to eat good and healthy food in Hyde Park without having to sacrifice much.Times have changed. The phone was unavailable for over an hour today for phone orders and when we walked all the way there the man in front says \"oh the phone must not be charged\". My past 4 orders have been wrong and slow to get to me (2 by phone and 2in person) my last order tonight was literally a simple pizza and add corn and after I walked all the way home I found out they had replaced my meat with corn. To their credit they did order me a fresh one and give me a refund on my money and deliver it. I'm done going here. Feels like the magical sparkle from my first few visits has faded into a dim and fading light.", "We ordered delivery and received our food 3 hours later. Yes. Three hours later. Let me paint that picture a little more clear-We put in our order at 6:30pm and it did not show up until 9:30pm. I'm also a firm believer that the only reason it showed up at all was because my boyfriend called after 2 hours to see what was going on. They said they \"made a mistake and the delivery man will be picking up the food in 10 minutes\" FROM THE RESTAURANT. After another half hour passed, I called to see what was going on and why it was taking so long. The guys response was \"we were just busy so had to adjust times accordingly\" HA! Wow. Seriously? The order arrived the moment we picked up the phone to cancel the order out. This place needs to seriously restructure their delivery system. Ready for the best part?? IT WAS NOT THE FOOD WE ORDERED. It was also cold and dry and disgusting. Needless to say, we demanded a refund. We'll see how that goes.", "Actually me and one of my colleagues were walking to another place and stumbled on this place ...the staff was really nice the homemade lemonade was really good and not something I normally would eat for lunch as its a bunch of food but the jerk chicken waffle bowl was pretty amazing. You can customize it with brown rice instead of the waffle fries and add your own toppings and you have a fairly healthy meal with a great taste! I recommend a visit if in Hyde park and want to try a new spot", "I eat here often and NEVER have had an issue with food or service. Tonight I did however! I called my order in and was told twenty minutes. I arrived to pick up in about thirty minutes given I rode past and saw they were busy. I ordered two orders of vegetarian tacos with different ingredients but both were to have mushrooms. One order didn't have mushrooms as ordered (of course it had to be mine) so I called back and spoke to Jerell (who took order from start..sorry if spelled name wrong) he apologized wholeheartedly for mishap AND offered to DELIVER my correct order. I told him don't worry about it he could just \"owe me\" next time. He insisted to rectify promptly. He def was man of his word and sent by way of delivery my correct order and it was FAST. You can't get much better customer service than that. Again to Jerell and Whole LiteHouse Grill thank you for standing by your brand, word and food! \u00a0As always I enjoyed my food!", "The food is fantastic! I have loved every item I ordered. I do not recommend delivery. They are so nice but incredibly slow and they do not have good systems in place to take orders. I have never heard of anywhere that takes your order and calls back in 30 minutes to take payment. So inefficient. Hopefully taking orders will improve in time. Go have a seat and eat in.", "Great food. It's organic & good for you so the prices were to be expected. When I think of Hyde Park...I think of the LiteHouse this place embodies the spirit of Hyde Park. I haven't found anything on the menu that I didn't like.", "I took my dad here for the first time a few weeks ago. We both ordered the Caribbean Mango Jerk Salmon (Bowl and Salad) and were thoroughly impressed by the quality of the food. Cozy spot with local artwork/gallery displays and soulful music. I found out that they delivered and took a few menu's for my family. I now have a personal mission to try everything on the menu. I'm glad that to see quality food businesses like this in the community and is definitely one of my top go to spots.", "Second time ordering in with Litehouse Grill and I am going to eat so good. Delivery til 9:30 or order your food and pick it up! Thank you for the great eats!! #vegantreats AWESOME!!!!!!", "I ordered from Grub Hub. Typically restaurants are great at keeping you posted about when your food will arrive.The Notification was sent that it was out for delivery. \u00a0But I had to wait almost 40 mins before it got to me. During this time I thought maybe there was a mix up. I attempted to call the The restaurant \u00a0serval times during this time period and each time it went directly to voice mail. I actually started wondering if I ordered from a closed restaurant. The results? \u00a0I actually didn't tip the delivery guy good at all. It takes me a lot to get me to that point but I got there. Food was good. I really enjoyed the Baja chicken nacho style and waffle fries w a side if got sauce. Great food! Lesson learned? If I would re order it would be for pick up or dine in.One place for sure that I would tell to get their ish straightened out!", "The customer service was decent, could be better.

However, our experience this past Saturday evening was such a profound disappointment on so many levels that we shall never return. The menu has been dumbed down to cafeteria-grade entrees bearing no resemblance to the menu posted online; the atmosphere has also been degraded to that of a cafeteria with bright lighting and excessively loud music; and the service was completeky untrained. The Parrot Cage is but a shadow of its former self. It no longer represents a palletable culinary experience much less a good value. The proof is in the pudding--the dining room was nearly empty. There were only three other tables seated. That speaks volumes.", "Parrot Cage February 13, 2015Valentine's Disappointment--Still a B+ for the StudentsWOW! What a difference a year makes. In my February 13, 2014 review I wrote: \"Six of us went to dinner at the Parrot Cage for a GREAT night out. ... An adequate wine list that was reasonably priced. Culinary students run this place? Really? Bon Appetite!\" What an ABOUT FACE for my experience on February 13, 2015. My experience last night warrants an overall grade B+ (down from the A+ I issued in 2011): Our Waiter Alex gets an A+++; the Hostess a D; the Manager a C+; and the Chef a B. Allow me to explain why the adults in the front of the house hurt the students' grade, and why our experience was somewhat disappointing.First and foremost, our 2014 experience lead to exceedingly high expectations for 2015. They recently remodeled and I was concerned they might not open in time for our dinner. Despite speaking to the hostess/manager/staff three times in the six weeks prior to this dining experience, including on the day of our dinner, not once did they bother to mention the major development of no longer having a valid liquor license--it's BYOB now. Literally 10 minutes before my 5 guest arrived I had to drive to 71st & Jeffery - in the hood - to purchase three bottles of the most average wine imaginable. I probably should not have been surprised when the hostess had an attitude with me because I politely expressed my displeasure with not having been told of this development. Her \"bad behavior\" was consistent with my previous experience there. In a review of Parrot Cage that I wrote on June 5, 2011, I stated: \"A relatively rude manager/hostess, and a pedestrian wine list, did not overshadow the otherwise outstanding front-of-the house service from these culinary students, and an exceptional very diverse menu with exceedingly well-prepared food by the back of the house.\" With regard to the food, my comments are generally the same as in my 2011 and 2014 reviews, although I had to send my steak back. I ordered medium rare, they delivered well-done. The second version was medium-well, but as everyone else had eaten, I ate the center of the steak and we moved on to the decadent dessert course. Our waiter Alex, and the other servers were the BEST aspect of the evening, other than the exceptional company of my guests.The most disappointing aspect of the evening was how much the ambience of this establishment has changed since it was remodeled last month. By removing the carpet (now tiled floors), drapes (no window treatments at all), and wallpaper (it was due to be changed), and adding bright lighting, they not only eviscerated the quaint and almost romantic aspect of the room, but the place is now loud. That does not excuse the rude old man who conned his way into a free meal, from interrupting our dinner to tell us to \"quiet down.\" Next year he won't have to worry about our group--we'll be at La Petite Folie where we started to go this year! Let me close by saying that if you chose to dine there, and I plan to, it's best for couples only. Large groups will resonate too loudly. By the way, did I mention that I'd give Alex an A+++", "Pricey but one of the best breakfast buffets on the south side. Ample \"free\" parking is a plus and the eating area is quaint and airy. Wait staff was very friendly as well and they catered 2 special requests.", "A beautiful little dining room in the clubhouse of the old South Shore Country Club that offers a Supper Club menu of meat and fish.Being a training ground for cooking school students the food was well prepared and hit the appropriate notes. The Caesar was a simple presentation of dressing, croutons, and parmesan laid over a bed of smoky grilled romaine. The Tilapia Entr\u00e9e consisted of a large filet laid over a bed of fresh green beans and drizzled with lobster sauce and tiny bits of tomato. The beans were firm without tasting raw and paired well with the sauce. The filet was pan seared to melt in your mouth perfection. A large piece of Tres Leche Chocolate Cake had just the right amount of milky goodness and ordered with Vanilla Ice Cream that was presented in a chocolate cup with a thick bottom, a decadent treat! The coffee was delicious as well.The servers were in training as well, very friendly and mostly on top of their duties. The salad arriving before our drinks was the only misstep. The dinner roll server came by twice and the host checked in to see how we were doing, a nice touch.The bill arrived with a scholarship charge of 5 percent added. This is more of a contribution to the students tuition fund than a gratuity so a regular tip is necessary, if not required. The additional gratuity must be paid in cash.Overall a pleasant dining experience in a historic setting. You will leave satisfied and feel good about helping the students on their path to success.", "Let me preface this review by saying that on another occasion, I had a most delightful experience at The Parrot Cage...such was NOT the case yesterday, and unfortunately it was Mother's Day!The Brunch Buffet was HORRIBLE ...and that's putting it mildly! Had it not been for the wonderful atmosphere and the company we were with, it would have been a COMPLETE disaster. From no plates, to cold food, to NO food, to JAMES BROWN serenading us after the Jazz Quartet packed up BEFORE the last guest departed, the EXPERIENCE was definitely memorable, but in the WRONG way. Perhaps the students need to stick to fine dining, because they flunked at buffet. As I mentioned before, my previous experience at The Parrot Cage was wonderful, but that was fine dining and not buffet. Perhaps they should stick to fine dining until the buffet is better tuned for the public!", "As a washburne alumni I always wanted to try this place out. They were talking about opening this restaurant right before I graduated, so I missed out. O well, I'm not in foodservice anymore anyway.The restaurant is very small but I really liked the decor. The students were very professional and the food was very good as well.", "The Parrot Cage is a hidden gem in the South Shore community inside of the historic South Shore Cultural Center. \u00a0This restaurant is ran by the Washburn Culinary School (Kennedy King College). \u00a0The students provide a 5 star dining experience on a dime. \u00a0The ambiance is breathtaking and is the perfect place for alfresco dining with the view of Lake Michigan in the background. \u00a0This is a perfect date spot and best of all, they offer BYOB for a small corking fee. \u00a0Please note that seating is by reservations only.", "I went to The Parrot Cage for the second time yesterday for Sunday brunch. \u00a0They have changed their brunch offerings since I was there last. \u00a0Much improved! The setting is just beautiful. \u00a0If you haven't been to the historic South Shore Cultural Center I'd highly recommend going. \u00a0The restaurant itself is decorated in a very charming way with, as you can imagine, lots of parrot related decorations. \u00a0Our server was very attentive, \u00a0refilling our glasses before they were even empty. \u00a0They had made to order omlettes and waffles. \u00a0They also had a a beautiful turkey breast cut to order. \u00a0They also had the usual offerings of bacon, sausages, salads, fried chicken. \u00a0 It looked like that there is an outdoor dining area just outside for warm weather dining. \u00a0I'll be back in summer!After brunch we sat in the lobby looking out the windows at the lakefront and took out our I Pad and Googled images of the South Shore Country Club and looked at dozens of old pictures of the space when it used to be a fancy members only country club. \u00a0The Park District has done a very good job restoring it. \u00a0We walked outside around the grounds after brunch. \u00a0This place is truly amazing. \u00a0Definitely worth the drive down Lake Shore Drive.", "Wanted to love this to support the culinary institute students.Great parts: \u00a0the food was delicious at the Sunday brunch. \u00a0Lots of meat. \u00a0Some of the best sliced turkey breast I've ever had.Not-so-great parts: \u00a0the servers were not good. \u00a0After being seated by the hostess, no one came to say \"hi\" or bring water until about 15 minutes later. \u00a0Once she came over, she was nice but had little tableside manner. \u00a0She took my son's plate mid-bite (with several bites left.) \u00a0She poured my coffee into the wrong cup. \u00a0She reached over us instead of serving at our right, etc. \u00a0I wouldn't worry about this, but she's supposedly learning how to serve in a fine restaurant, as well as how to work in the kitchen. \u00a0Actually, our server told us she'd graduated and had gotten a real job there. \u00a0Maybe she was just having a bad day.I'm not a complaining customer, but there were so many issues (gnats b/c patio doors were open) that they gave us one brunch gratis. \u00a0That was really nice.We will go back, because, again, we want the students to succeed. \u00a0And the free brunch helped. \u00a0But they need to refine the service a bit.", "I loved, loved, loved this place! I love the fact that it is housed in the beautiful and historically rich South Shore Cultural Center for starters. As others have mentioned, this is truly a hidden gem on the South Side. I also loved that the place is run by the Washburne(sp?) students. I think it's an excellent concept and you get to witness first-hand these students developing their craft.As for the food, excellent. I went on a Wednesday with the prix fixe menu, which was a steal. I had the grilled caesar salad that was done just right and the lamb for my entree, which was so tender it almost fell off of the bone! My dining partners also enjoyed their meals. One of them had the pork chop that was so huge it was almost unreal. And, despite its size, she also said that it was done to perfection! It's a classy place and the dining room was packed with a diverse crowd, with multiple people who found the place pleasurable enough to celebrate their birthdays there that night. \u00a0I will definitely be back to try their brunch buffet. I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a fine dining experience!", "Hidden gem!I would never have heard of the Parrot Cage if not for searching for Wednesday prix fixe specials on Yelp. The restaurant definitely suffers from a lack of marketing... We couldn't even find any signs on the outside of the South Shore Cultural Center telling visitors that the Parrot Cage was inside, so we weren't positive we were in the right place until we walked in. I had never heard of the place before seeing it on Yelp. The South Shore Cultural Center is a gem itself! I found out that it's where President Barack Obama and Michelle held their wedding reception, and it is listed on the historic register. The marble stairs, chandeliers, and architectural details are stunning!Upon entering, we were sure glad we found the Parrot Cage! We were there for about an hour and a half, and the entire time, there was only one other table of two diners there. With the quality of the food and the beauty of the atmosphere, it should be filled. There are very few restaurants with a view of the lakefront, and the food holds it own as well. The goat-cheese flan alone is worth the trip! My husband also raved about his jambalaya. He finished the etouff\u00e9e entree in short order, pronouncing it \"very good,\" and I also enjoyed my crab-encrusted catfish. For dessert, my husband said the peach cobbler was among the best he'd had, and my banana bread pudding was good as well, although just a bit on the dry side. Maybe more sauce would have helped? We also enjoyed a couple of the signature cocktails, the Parrot Martini and the Pineapple Martini. \u00a0Overall, I would give the food and service and solid 4 stars, while the beauty of the location rates a 5. We will make an effort to return... the Wednesday prix fixe is a great value!", "A beautiful nostalgic restaurant where the Washburne Culinary Institute students prepare the meals. The star of the experience is the restaurant and the location being right on Lake Michigan; while dining my mind wondered what really went on here during the country club years. \u00a0The food was delicious, and the service was polite. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for something different or romantic and after the meal why not take a walk around the grounds if you visit on the weekend you will most likely see a wedding or a reception taking place. Like Corinne G. said this place really is a hidden gem!", "Went here with hubby for the 87.7FM Sunday Brunch. \u00a0I thought the food was pretty good, my favorite was the Jambalaya, my least favorite was the dressing aka Stuffing. I loved the ambiance, and the building which has an old southern charm to it, not to mention our family used to visit the park in general for the 80's committee picnics when I was a youngin. \u00a0I would recommend Parrot Cage to others because it helps support the culinary school, and it's students which did an awesome job at cooking. \u00a0The service was great. \u00a0The \"Noteworthy Band\" was wonderful. \u00a0If you're ever in the area, I would recommend you give this place a try.", "Not a huge reviewer, but had to comment on this place. First of all, I've been going to the South Shore Cultural Center since I was a little boy. I spent many a year in their summer camp program. I though it was an awesome place then, and I think the facility is an awesome place now. The views (when it's not pouring rain, like last night) are wonderful and the overall atmosphere is just great.With that said, the Parrot Cage received 4 stars from me. The food was excellent (I had the Pan Seared Tilapia), our server was nice and attentive and even apologetic when my Aunt's fish was a little too spicy for her tastes and couldn't be redone for her. She even went the extra mile to not charge my Aunt for the drink that she had. \u00a0My biggest complaint however, is that it took what felt like 5 years for us to get our food after we ordered. I never knew it took that long to cook what was a majority of fish dishes. However, the plating of each dish in my opinion was really nice.I've read a few harsh reviews about the restaurant here and the only think I can think of is that because they are students, maybe they rotate out and you don't have the same people there every year, because everyone was pleasant from the moment we walked into the door to the minute we walked out.", "What a unique and interesting dining experience!The Parrot Cage restaurant is the kitchen and stomping grounds of a culinary school, but you hardly notice and the food and service are wonderful! \u00a0The restaurant is located in the gorgeous South Shore Cultural center/country club that I now want to research.We were seated at a table with a lovely view of the lake and our server greeted us quickly. \u00a0The wine list is small, but all of the glasses are offered for $6 and the bottles are all $24. \u00a0The menu includes a wide variety of items and you can choose anything you want for the prix fixe menu, which is $30 (we lucked out and got it for $19 because there was a special promotion).We started with the shrimp and grits and the crawfish soup. \u00a0The soup was hearty and spicy and the grits were TO DIE FOR. \u00a0If this place was not so hard for us to get to than I would return often for these. \u00a0For our entrees we had the salmon and the steak. \u00a0The salmon was nicely prepared, however the steak had a lot of fat on it. \u00a0For dessert we had the banana bread pudding and the cookie sundae. \u00a0The cookie was impressive as it was freshly baked in a hot skillet, however it did not taste quite as good as it looked.Overall, I would give the food three stars, however I bumped it up to four as the venue was just so impressive.The check is a little strange here are they charge an automatic 10% gratuity. \u00a0I added an additional 10% on top of this (to make it 20%) but then when I asked my server about it, she said that the 10% gratuity was actually for a scholarship and did not go to her so I am not sure if you are supposed to add 20% on top of the 10% already included....THE FACTS:Prix-fixe is $30 on Wednesday and Thursday night (anything on the menu)Corkage is $5There is a 10% gratuity/scholarship added to your bill", "Always good, well presented food.Excellent service from wait staff.We also enjoy the low background music and the decor.", "I chose this restaurant because of its name (The Parrot Cage ... ridiculous and awesome?) and because it's part of a culinary school, which usually leads to good and cheaper results. Also BYOB. ($5 corkage fee)The setting is amazing. It's in the South Shore Cultural Center, which is right on Lake Michigan and a beautiful old building. It's a bit of a hike from the North side, but worth it.The service is a little slow (as is the crowd in general, lots of older people), but the food is great and the staff is so friendly and nice. And it's always fun to support students. They start with this delicious seed-bread? I'm not great with tastes (or memory - it's been almost three years since I've been there), but it was bread with some seeds in it or something. Whatever, it was great.

The customer service isn't the greatest either, but hey this isn't a 5 star steakhouse so it doesn't bother me. It is definitely at bit pricey compared to other fried chicken joints but worth it.", "There are two Harold's close to the U of C: 53rd and 64th and Cottage. I prefer 53rd. Let me tell you why.While I do think that the chicken at this location is better - fresher, crispier, more saucy - and that it comes with a greater abundance of fries [53rd seems to have cut the fry allotment some time in early 2011] - it is substantially more expensive and only includes 1 (as opposed to 2) pieces of white bread. For my typical meal, the 1/2 dark with S&P hot and dark sauces, I pay somewhere under 5 at 53rd unless it's on special (Sun-Wed), in which case I pay 3.51. HOT DAMN! At the 64th-st. location, today, I dish out 7.17 for that same meal. Although I was not given a receipt, I think this cost reflected tax and extra-sauce fees, neither of which are extra at the 53rd st. Harold's. I didn't see any signs about specials, and while I was there,a woman came in and asked whether there was a lunch special and the answer was in the negative. In addition to the other advantages, the crew at this Harold's seems more personable and sociable. At 53rd they're all business, probably because they have more of it. At 64th, the wait is longer, but that's not really a problem, because you can always call in to either location.However, the other reason I prefer the 53rd location is because I feel unequivocally and consistently safe there. Walking down Cottage to the 64th location does not confer the same sense of security. Even during the day, it is a relatively more risky endeavor.Note: Sam O. who also reviews the 53rd and 64th locations, disagrees with me and has the exactly opposite preferences. Without giving specific reasons, he claims that he \"still wasn't very impressed\" by the chicken at 53rd. Surprisingly, he writes, \"By the way, this location [53rd] has the nerve to be more expensive than the other Harold's in the city!

A couple of days ago, I ordered my food and when I came to the glass window, the guy who was at the register was staring at me like I interrupted his work.

They never notified us that our hour was about to end, there was no one else there, they had started the timer before we started bowling, and this reeked of a business strategy gone awry.

I always order the same thing....Curry Salmon Stir Fry. \u00a0It is the best yet!!", "VERY GOOD FOOD. \u00a0Even though I can't vouch for it's Trinidadian Authenticity I have to say this is VERY delicious food. \u00a0This unassuming, intimate sized, casual dining location offers many dishes to treat and tentelize the discerning palate. \u00a0Food, ordered at the registered, is \u00a0brought to your table when ready and usually does not take a long time. \u00a0When I got done with my plate, they almost didn't have to wash it... yes it was that good. \u00a0The location is right on 47th street and is a short drive from either Lake Shore Drive or I94 (the Dan Ryan Expressway). \u00a0The staff and management are very friendly and checked to make sure everything was great. \u00a0I can't wait to go back.Personally speaking, parking can be a little tricky and I would LOVE for them to have longer opening hours, say until 9 PM at least. \u00a0Outside of that, you \"must go\" here for lunch or early dinner.", "Nothing going on here but deliciousness! I love food from the islands and Cafe Trinidad did not disappoint.I've been here a couple of times...dining in and for pickup. The jerk chicken is really good and the jerk sauce is a little different from what I am used to. This version of the sauce was a little lighter in terms of color and is a little sweeter than the Jamaican version I am used to....really good though. All entrees come with your choice of rice (white or brown), peas, plantains and curry steamed vegetables which are really good especially when mixed in with the rice. I have also had the curry salmon and it is really good...the flavor is phenomenal and melts in you mouth. Portions are a really nice size FYI.The people that work here are really nice and always make sure you are satisfied with your meal.The place itself is small as I think they have about five tables for dining but they make it for the size with delicious food that you can get with carry-out/pickup. I love this place!", "So I tried Cafe Trinidad for the first time tonight. My experience was more than underwhelming. I ordered curry chicken roti for myself and stew chicken dinner for my friend. The service was quick which I like. \u00a0But during the short time I waited there were 4 kids running around the dining area being very disruptive. I tried the stew chicken I bought my friend and it was extremely bland. No stew flavor what so ever. And my curry chicken was bland as well. These meals had no spice to them. Either they toned down the flavors to make them more American or someone in the kitchen doesn't know how to make traditional trini food. \u00a0I won't be going back.", "I enjoy the goat tacos from this place. The only drawback is that they don't fully de-bone the goat and you can happen upon a shard or two of goat bone. This can be very dangerous if you are not careful. Therefore, I wouldn't suggest this item for children. The sauce that they offer with the taco is very tasty as well. Service is fast and cordial. The parking lot is tiny and street parking can be scarce depending on the time of day that you visit.", "Had two jerk chicken tacos they were great chicken was fresh an tacos were a great size most definitely will have again", "To say I was disappointed with my meal today would be a huge understatement. I've been patronizing Cafe Trinidad for years, since they were in their old location on 75th street, so I thought I knew what to expect from this establishment. Good Lord was I wrong!My bad experience started when I opened the container to the Mac and cheese pie, and to my surprise, there was hardly half of a scoop for the serving size. Cmon yall........you charge almost 5 bucks for a side item like Mac and cheese, and you only give the customer 50 cents worth. I guess I wouldn't have been as upset if the Mac and cheese was any good, but alas it wasn't. The top was thoroughly burnt and overall there was no flavor, let alone cheese. I'm something of an expert on such things so I would rate this Mac and cheese a 3 out of 10. Next was the shrimp roti, which I've had several times from this location, and although it has never been able to hold a candle to something like Teddy's in Washington DC, it was always pretty decent and cheaper than airfare to the nation's capital. I don't know if this place changed owners, cooks, or what... The whole thing was just really subpar. Especially the shrimp! Oh my... They tasted freezer burnt and were the size of sea monkeys. I ended up picking all the shrimp out of the roti they were so bad. I guess what sucks the most is that for the $15 I spent today there are TONS of other options here in Chicago. Even on the south side! JJ Fish would've been a better bet. Geez, probably even McDonald's and I haven't eaten there in a decade. Hopefully a better Trinidadian place opens up soon or I'll just save my roti craving for when I'm on the east coast.", "Simply authentic and amazing! Coming from someone who is a Cali native, I must say. I want to come back to Chicago specifically for this chicken curry roti!!Been miserable ever since I got back home. Just such bold and yummy flavors in everything that you cannot find on the west coast! Highly recommend!", "The food at this place is good. The problem is that I asked for 3 different items that were either not available or not ready yet (Curry Crab, Dumplings & Callalloo, Bake & Fish, Phoulori). On top of that I called the order in, which I was told would take 25 minutes. I arrived about 25 minutes later and had to wait an additional 20 minutes. I tried curry, stew and jerk chicken, curry goat and the jerk chicken roti.I really enjoyed the stew and jerk chicken. Also the roti was huge.The food gets a 4. The customer service gets a 1", "It was just ok..called in with a Groupon...online the jerk chicken dinner is 10.50 got charged 12.00. The food was Luke warm like it had already been sitting there. Also ordered Trini tacos they were tasty but cold. Overall glad I had a Groupon cuz I would've been upset had I paid full price..I feel they overcharged me because I had a Groupon.", "OMG I never knew what roti was til I happened to step in on a whim at 6:45 right before they closed at 7. Apparently roti is like a Caribbean pot pie or pasty in a wrap typically filled with a curried meat and potato. Once I saw they had goat I was SOLD. But coming in right before closing I was honestly expecting a lil attitude or slightly shittier service cuz everyone wants to go home. Naaah they hooked a brother up with no qualms and that roti was succulently delicious! Think I found my new post work treat! If only the goat roti was boneless, I had to find out the hard way after a big bite haha. But shit was too good to complain", "Having had some authentic Trini food, thanks to a great friend from Trinidad, I was curious to see how Cafe Trinidad would fare. It's unfair that I automatically fall in love with Caribbean food since I am Caribbean. But there is something to be said for authenticity.Curry chicken. Plantains. Rice and beans. Cabbage. Ginger beer.It may be my accent that caused my food to come out spicy. I am not one to complain about my food having a kick to it, but when I don't have to request that it come spicy and it does, I'm won over. The chicken was tender enough to eat with a plastic spoon. Yes, you read that correctly. Everything was a hit. I have to go back later to try some of the specials on the menu.", "This is a small restaurant on the corner. \u00a0The food was a little bland and the atmosphere was nice. It appears clean and the portions are large.", "I was a fan of Cafe Trinidad when they were located on 75th and St. Lawrence, so when I learned that they had not closed up shop, but were relocating to 47th, just west of Cottage Grove, I determined to make my way there! I had fond memories of the Macaroni Pie, Curried Salmon and Vegetables, and Peach Cobbler to sustain me while waiting for them to reopen. After a couple of false starts, and a blank trip, I finally made it yesterday. I have my fellow Yelpers, and previous experience, to thank for the wisdom to call ahead and verify their hours AND the availability of my desired culinary delights. I had the Boneless Jerk Chicken Roti (good curry flavor, though not so much Jerk), Macaroni Pie (a good sized serving of well-cheesed of noodles, only lacking a bit of salt & pepper), some of my friends plantains (perfectly crisp edges, soft centers, and ripe-plaintain goodness!), Sauteed Cabbage (tasty, not overcooked, with bonus carrots and peppers), and the Peach Cobbler (peaches, cinnamon, sugar, crust--what's not to like?) for dessert.As several others have mentioned,this space does leave a bit to be desired. Not nearly as spacious and gracious as the prior location (I HATE that they moved!), there is seating for about six (6) parties in the back, with a couple of high tables in the front waiting/order area. The Reggae/Caribbean music was creating a nice vibe, there was a small heater making sure we weren't cold, and all was well with my tummy!Welcome back, Cafe Trinidad!", "My daughter and I went there on last week, we tried to order the ox tail chicken combo meal but they were out of oxtails so we ordered the jerk chicken dinner, it didn't taste like jerk at all it tasted like a spicy baked chicken. The white meat was bone dry, the cabbages, rice and peas were tasty but had bits of bone through out them that we had to keep spitting out. We had the so called homemade lemonade which tasted like sugar water no lemon flavor at all! Overall the meal was horrible! The sever was nice!", "This place is awesome!! Takes me all the way back to Trinidad. It's as authentic as they come. Only place in Chicago to get the true Trini flavor. Get Curry chicken roti, and an order of doubles. Doubles is a vegetarian concoction from curry and garbanzos they call chana. Order plenty spice with the magic haba\u00f1ero hot sauce so popular in the island!! Just ordered. My mouth is already watering!!", "The boy loved his ginger beer. Holy hell the food was so good! Well worth the drive into the ghetto, it's cool there's parking upfront.

I rate this place both the best restaurant in Hyde Park and a legit good restaurant, even not grading on the Hyde Park curve. The ramen is very nice -- flavorful broths, decent noodles, some nice fixings, though all of the bowls would be better with more vegetables, and the broth on my LoganPoserRamen was a little one-dimensional (though the one dimension was, again, a flavorful one). \u00a0But the Japanese pancake appetizer is really terrific, with a mess of crispy pancake base, interesting vegetable textures, and other things I couldn't even quite fathom. \u00a0I would happily eat that in any neighborhood in Chicago.They were only half full at 6:45 on a Friday night, so I started to worry about them a little, but they seemed to be packed by the time we left, so that bodes well. Long live Yusho.", "I've had great experiences at the Yusho in Logan Square so I decided to go to the one in Hyde Park during my lunch break. This location is smaller, more casual, and very modern. \u00a0My friend and I split the Japanese loaded fries. The presentation was nice, but the very thinly sliced meat on top was so hot that it wavered in the air for 5-7 minutes after being placed on the table. I am not going to lie, it freaked me out a little bit. I also did not care for the large chunks of ginger I sporadically ran into. I love to overload on ginger when I am eating sushi, but it didn't do it for me with fries. The fries themselves were mediocre at best--I am the person that will eat all the fries that look a little softer in the middle first, so this wasn't a good match for me considering they were all on the crispier side. However, I really appreciated the spicy aiolo and I wish there was more of it!I ordered the Grilled Calamari, which did not have many of the ingredients included in the dish listed on the menu. I liked about 70% of the things that ended up in my bowl. There were slices of apples and crispy wontons that I did personally did not care for, and felt they interfered with my enjoyment of the veggies and calamari (which was perfectly textured). Typically, I have food-guilt when I don't finish something that I know is in my power, but this time I left a decent amount of what I did not finish in my bowl. My friend ordered the Yusho Bop and I secretly wanted to eat her entire dish when she went to the bathroom after a single bite. I will definitely come back to Yusho, but I will be getting anything other than what I ordered this time around.", "After two bad experiences, I gave Yusho one star but resolved to give them a third chance someday. That someday was a few weeks ago and I was so blown away by the improvement in service AND cuisine (udon with pork belly and pears!), my husband and I have been back every weekend since. Plus, the manager is awesome and incredibly hardworking as he's been there literally every time we've been in. Five SOLID stars.", "The food took over two hours to be delivered, and it was terrible and expensive. Not much to like. Correction, the pork belly bun was tasty, but that was it. The ramen was absolutely terrible, the donuts were gross, and the service was crap. No one offered an explanation or discount or anything when we called after waiting forever. Too bad- should be amazing or the price.", "Cute place, love the decor, service is great, food is mediocre, prices are too high. You can tell that they're trying for a slightly more upscale vibe, but fall short, leaving their prices unjustified. The food is pretty average, and portions are small (I expect to be drowning in noodles and broth when I hit up a ramen place). I had the logan poser ramen, all for the pig tail and the 60 minute egg. The pig tail was fried and placed on a skewer on the top of my bowl... there wasn't much of it and it made no sense for it to be so separate from the noodles/broth. Pretty meager amount of other toppings in my soup as well. My friend ordered the udon, and there wasn't much in her udon beside udon (even that, there wasn't much of). Service is very attentive and quick though!", "I love this place!!!!!! They have the best burgers ever. The atmosphere is great and i love the staff.

(1/1)Service: the service is pretty quick. I was satisfied with their service. \u00a0(1/1)Food: the food especially ramen is not satisfying my craving. I got veggie ramen. The broth is way too salty. The veggies for some reason tasted sour, even the tofu. I really hope they were not spoiled or else I might have a stomachache later tonight then . (0/2) Cost: $12-15 for each ramen bowl. Too expensive for a small quantity of ramen. There are other ramen places in Chicago and especially in California that are same price but HUGE portion!

I went to their soft opening that A10 hosted, but I liked the experience at the actual restaurant even more. The service is excellent. The servers are attentive, do a great job explaining the menu, and they're super friendly. The restaurant itself is very casual, and cozy. I went for lunch on a Saturday, and there were only a few tables occupied which I can't understand. They're is a pretty decent sized patio, for Hyde Park. Beware of the white cloth napkins because they shed a bit. \u00a0The prices are reasonable and they make it easy for parties to share just about anything including the ramen.The food is flavorful and creative. I love the ramen; I've had the BBQ chicken and pig tail. I also really like the steamed buns. This visit I had the fried chicken and the the Filipino sausage and they were both awesome. Oh, and they make their own pickles and I LOVE them. I wish they sold them by the jar. \u00a0I also recommend that you try the loaded fries on the snack menu; they're so good.

The sauce tastes like a mix of butter, teriyaki sauce and a little bit sriracha, which is horrible. Tried the logan poser ramen too, which was okay nothing surprising. The okonomiyaki is disgusting, wayyyyyy too salty. The service is slowwwwwwwwww. Twenty minutes wait for ramen? That's just ridiculous.", "Yusho, was a no no for me. I was really really excited to hear that this new location opened up in Hyde Park since I had heard amazing things about the ramen and such, but in reality it ended up being overpriced I feel ($7 for one little bao/steamed bun? kind of steep if you ask me!) and the ramen actually wasn't that flavorful either. And I do love me some ramen and I also equally love me some fusion restaurants which Yusho definitely is. You will not be getting traditional anything here food wise, but a lot of fusion flavors of American wood with Japanese food which I think is a great concept, and I one I still definitely stand by too. We got the poser ramen with the crispy pork tail and that pork tail was in fact pretty darn tasty! BUT the rest of the ramen was just so so for us. It was fine an all, but just didn't pack that fun ramen broth flavor and there weren't quite enough of those cucumbers in it either for me. We also got a fried oyster steamed bun and a fried chicken steamed bun and they were both also just so so as well--although if I picked a winner it would have been the oyster one, but at $7 a piece these things are not that big. I think for $1 more this place could probably afford to serve two to make it not so awkward to share at a table. We also got the squash fried fritters that were pretty sweet in taste with some chunks of eel and stuff and I think this was probably the best part of the meal other than the crispy pork and what can really beat crispy pork?? Ya. That's what I thought. They do have a great beer selection here and all kinds of unique Japanese whiskeys I don't think you can get many other places, and they have a small patio seating area outside which was packed since it is finally nice outside here in Chicago. But in general just average to me, so still on my search for the best ramen in the city!", "The shrimp tempura was AMAZING. i also got the 2x fried chicken steamed roll and that was amazing too. service was fast and my server was really nice. I'll definitely be back here!", "BBQ ramen (or something) was really salty, almost to the point of being uneatable... Vegetable ramen was better, but still just... ok. like, I don't know about paying $15 each for this stuff", "We love Yusho and are so happy to have them in HP. We have gone for both lunch and dinner and have been stoked on both experiences! The service is great and the food is on point.The Ramen, oh the ramen. Awesome. The steamed buns are a good starter and the loaded fries are unique and tasty!They also have some unique beers from Japan. The Tokyo Black is our new favorite. Try it if you haven't already, it's incredible!", "Came here for dinner on a Monday night, there were a good number of guests but plenty of seating still. When we walked in the manager recognized my friend from her coming in once before, they're definitely an attentive group!Our server Isaiah was great, very knowledgeable and passionate about the menu. For drinks he suggested the daiquiri and the sake Kikusui. The daiquiri is actually called the \"citrus booze soda\" on the menu, but according to Isaiah, that is a totally unsexy name so they call it the Daiquri. It is a refreshing and citrusy, not to sweet. I enjoyed the Kikusui, it's an unfiltered sake, smooth and sweet.Housemade pickles - this is a nice Asian take on pickles, with pickled lotus root, carrots and what I think is jicama. The raw lotus roots definitely very interesting, I usually like them cooked, and this is the first time I had them raw. A good thing to try though some people may not like the slightly chalky texture of the raw lotus.Pork Belly Bun - braised pork belly with cucumber garnish on a steamed bun. Isaiah recommended this one and it definitely was quite tasty. The pork belly was melt in your mouth tender and the tartness of the cucumber complemented the richness of the pork belly well.Vegetable ramen and Poser Ramen - The broths were flavorful and the noodles were al dente. The pig tail in the pose ramen is actually more like ground pork sausage on a stick (a bit like kafta at a meditteranean place) and dotted with mustard seeds on top. The vege \u00a0ramen has mushrooms and tofu in it. Both are good to try, different from your usual ramen. Coconut cream Panna Cotta - rich and fruity with the raspberries and blueberries. The ying yang design they made on top of it was a sweet touch!Great new restaurant in Hyde Park. Prices are reasonable for the area.", "Another new addition to Hyde Park that is naively out of touch with the student demographic. Prices are WAY too high for the quality of food. I feel justified writing a review because I went with a huge group and we tried virtually every vegetarian thing on the menu, including all the appetizers. Service was friendly, but some of the appetizers came out way after the entrees, as if the kitchen were running behind.My food impressions in detail:The loaded fries had a tasty sauce but quite greasy and a little floppy, perhaps oil not hot enough for that perfect crisp. Eggplant skewers were also tasty but nothing special, kind of greasy. The tofu buns seem like the best veggie item on the menu. Ramen, on the other hand, mostly just tasted salty, lacking that special umami (maybe needs more mushroom richness?). I adore pickles, but I was even disappointed with those -- they tasted only like pure rice vinegar, no other nuance to the brine. And the entree I ordered, Yusho bop, was my biggest disappointment. The thing I usually love about bi-bim-bop is the amazing variety of flavors and textures, with several kinds of pickles and vegetables and sauces all in the same bowl. The Yusho bop only contains rice, a couple pickles, a few mushrooms here and there, ONE sauce, and a fancy-shmancy-60-minute-egg that had a weird sticky texture -- the very thing that makes it fancy also prevents the yolk from running over the rice, the best part of bi-bim-bop!So in short: the menu is over-thought and overpriced, fancy just for its own sake, without a careful attention to the actual flavors of the food.THAT SAID, the beer selection is great and reasonably priced.

I think this is a great addition to the neighborhood also with the garden and the bike box (where I bought my great bike by the way) . As much as I enjoy the food, particularly the festival (I get it as my side with dinner then order an extra side of it). I have also come to see this space as a gathering area. A black run business in a black neighborhood that cares about the future of the community is a beautiful thing, so my son and I happily spend our dollars and time there. I will say that I wish they had a jug of water and maybe a paper cup for purchase or sign encouraging people to carry water bottles. :) But I also personally love how green they are.

(Great job).You won't find the same sides like a lot of other places.He was very good at coming out with a new kick for his own style of jerk sauce.I was just taking away with the saltfish fritters.If you have had fritters from the Bahamas or Jamaica while on vacation Well now you can go to this place and have them over and over again.

I've heard the food is pretty good, but I was also very confused as to how bread is considered a side. From what I recall, there were no vegetables on the menu at all. Including cabbage. A jerk chicken restaurant with no cabbage and no macaroni and cheese and no red beans and rice. Just bread, plantains, fritterlings (whatever the hell those are), and some other lil shit that didn't sound appetizing. Again, the menu wasn't impressive, so I was contemplating if I wanted to eat there, but the shitty, irritable attitude behind the counter sealed the deal for me. Might try it again, but I doubt it.

Well, I think we may have found the right place. \u00a0Go to try a new restaurant but stay because of the jerk chicken!! \u00a0It's amazing.

Came in on a Sunday afternoon with a friend.. We order the Jerk Chicken and I loooove jerk anything... The chicken had good flavor but not jerk flavor, more like flamed broiled taste and the white meat was really dry. The jerk sauce was weird to say the least.. My main gripe is really about the fact that they have NO vegetables on the menu.. What the heck? I couldn't believe it!! Sweet potato fries? Dry bread? The only side in my opinion worth trying is the Plantains (those were delicious). \u00a0No cabbage? \u00a0Anyway, maybe these are just growing pains..

My significant other and I order two chicken dinners with sweet potatoes fries and plantains. The chicken breast was on the dry side with some of the other chicken being a little crispy. The plantains are by far the best I ever had! I was not fond of the sauce or hush puppy cornbread pieces. It get a sense that the meal is missing something, usually with other jerk chicken venues you have rice/beans and cabbage. I wish they served a salad or other green leafy entree option on their menu. I checked in with my yelp app and I was awarded a free sorrel limeade. OMG! The only way I can describe this drink as lime sugar water. I think it is messing a shot of something if you get my drift?

The restaurant has introduced strong curb appeal in an area that has sadly become littered with typical hood fast food joints that do nothing to enhance the quality of life of its residents; the Jerk Shack is the complete opposite. They have a clean & well-lit exterior front w/ outdoor seating and a nicely renovated interior. The Rastafarian music streaming thru the speakers was good and complimentary to the dining experience. The chicken I ordered was pretty good and the sweet potato fries were on point. As a new Bronzeville resident, I appreciate a new, quality restaurant option within the community. However, there is obvious room for improvement and here's to hoping the owner/manager will address:1.) Food portions are underwhelming. I ordered the lunch jerk chicken special expecting my appetite to be reasonably satisfied, but man was I disappointed. The chicken portion seemed to be equivalent to 1/8th of a chicken, and the sauce, as flavorful as it was, wasn't even enough to spread 1/8th the portion I got. The sauce is important; don't be so frugal towards your customers. Also, the lime juice and sorrel were both very bitter and could've maybe used more sugar to balance. 2.) Please add more sides menu items. I understand this is a new business but no rice & beans?! C'mon. Uncle Joe's can do it; why can't you?3.) Customer service is paramount to a business's credibility and long-term success. Friendly engagement and eye contact goes a long way at the counter. This was lacking on the day I visited, even though there weren't many customers. The young lady seemed to have a tough time multitasking; maybe it was just that day, but I wasn't impressed. Plus the order took awhile (abt 35 mins), which seemed very long considering the small food portion.4.) Suggestion: Add a long seating bench against the wall for larger group seating, and then line up a series of small tables...viola, you'll immediately have more dining space. Also it might be a good idea to add some bar stools for the seating area along the windows. Seems like they were missing. It's nice to have another healthy dining spot in the Bronzeville community that fills a void. I will definitely give them another try & recommend others to check out. They're a new business that has room to grow. Hopefully the ownership will take my critical feedback in stride. I do feel this place has unlocked potential!", "Serving size is very small and they don't have jerk Rice ...

I felt like the beer selection was more affordable up here than down on the concourses, plus they had a lot of fun signature cocktails to order up. Also, they actually give you glass pints to drink from up here, which is nice.The food selection looked good, and reasonable. There was a pretzel option for $15, for example, and the pretzel came with 3 dipping options and was HUGE. Seemed fair because you could easily split it between 3 people!

Their menu choices are fair...the burgers with fries looked okay. I ordered the Italian Beef which was dry and tasteless, but the Garlic potato chips were good. The pulled pork sandwich looked better. Their french fries are fresh cut so I liked them but I prefer to eat in the park...a good grilled hot dog with mustard and grilled onions and nachos with cheese. The park also served great elotes (corn) and churros and just great junk food and that's what going to a ballpark is for! Next time I come to the park, I will skip the Stadium Club and stick with some good old fashioned hot dogs done just right and nachos!", "My group had never been to the stadium club before, so we were excited to get to see what it was all about. First off, it's a definite maze to get to. The hype going up made us really pumped. We had 4 sets of people check our tickets on the way up, and were so excited to get in there! However our bubble was quickly deflated. Not nearly as exclusive as we are lead to believe. We find a table and wait 10 min for a waitress to acknowledge our presence. Our friends decided to head back to the seats, but the man and I decided to stick it out and try some food. Now our server Amanda was so nice, but I don't think any amount of niceness could have made up for the sad sad food we got. We ordered the south side dippers and what we were given was legit day old pizza cut into strips. It was lukewarm and yet still burnt. I could barely eat more than 2 bites before giving up.

We easily found a table and sat down upon entering the club. The ambience was great as both the Sox game and the Bulls playoff game was on TV, lot of cheering and camaraderie in the restaurant. The service was just OK although our server was very nice. It took awhile to get his attention and once we ordered, the meals took awhile to be delivered. Our first drink did not come very quickly and the second round took longer. The food was excellent, a heaping beef brisket and Italian beef sandwich, better than the typical bar food. Overall, a very good experience and a very nice way to watch the game when the weather outside is not optimal.", "Good food for a ball park stadium club buffet.

The service and attendants are extremely pleasant and attentive. Venue is nicely appointed and some seating areas have great views of the field. In the upper level bar, a reservation is required to sit at the rail right at the windows, though. We sat on the next level up and could see the field well. There are plenty of TV monitors although you cannot hear anything on the field nor the TV broadcasts in the eating area. In the lobby you can hear Sox radio. The venue is a great place to relax to get away from the hot sun and heat. Credit cards only, no cash and there is a dress code although this late in the season, it was pretty lax.However, we were disappointed in the quality of the food. We didn't go for the buffets b/c none in our group is a big eater. A turkey burger was thin and the french fries almost tasteless. BBQ chicken sandwich had very little meat and was almost all sauce. Hot brownie sundae was a major disappointment - small brownie, a bit of ice cream and mostly all whipped cream and we waited a long time for it, too. For the prices we expected better and especially because the concession food outside of the Stadium Club is rather good. The soft serve swirl is much better than the ice cream we had on the brownie sundae. Food needed to match the ambiance. For a first-time experience it was enjoyable, though. If you want to sit in comfortable place and have low expectations for dining, the Stadium Club fits the bill.", "*Yawn* Yes, that's what I think of this place. Other than getting away from the heat in some air conditioning I'm not that impressed. The food is overpriced and not that good and unless you have reserved seats you're likely not going to be sitting close enough to really see the game, if at all. Plus it's in the outfield so unless your seats are in a worse location you're better off sitting in the seats you paid for instead of coming here.Visited: June 24, 2012", "After having eaten at the Stadium Club at the United Center several times, I thought I knew what this experience would be like. \u00a0Usually a buffet, usually a table for 4, in a clubby type atmosphere.Therefore, imagine my surprise when we got to the Club before our hosts and went through a variety of missteps before finding our \"table\".The Stadium Club is split into two distinct levels- the downstairs level which is more of what I have experienced at the other stadium with it's large buffets and seating that turns over every hour and a half. \u00a0Upstairs is the bar. \u00a0It's like a sports bar- except the sports is live through huge floor to ceiling windows overlooking the field. \u00a0Here the food is casual bar food- with the plus being someone actually waits on you versus the buffet area downstairs.The hostess at the upper area checked her list and then led us to our \"table\" \u00a0Imagine my surprise when that table turned out to be a series of backless stools lined up along a wall facing away from the game! \u00a0While there was a small shelf area on which to place my beer- no one wanted to sit facing away from the game so we decided a little improvisation was needed.With beers on the shelf, we sat with our backs to the shelf and our food balanced on our laps. \u00a0Not ideal, obviously. \u00a0If you go- insist on one of the many tables they have, or to sit by the windows facing OUT!The food was okay. \u00a0Nachos were nachos and the burger on a pretzel roll was fine. \u00a0Other items on the bar menu were a \"Carving board\" for deli sandwiches and a small list of bar appetizers. \u00a0Our server, Melissa, was personable and friendly and quick with our drinks, which I am sure was no small feat given how crowded this place was. \u00a0And know, if you go, that credit cards rule here so you must present one when you first arrive.I guess the benefit here is that if you don't want to sit in your seats outside, you can stay in the bar area in air conditioned comfort and watch the game through the glass. \u00a0We stayed long enough for the sun to move from our seats and headed out for a more traditional night at the ball game.For me? \u00a0Part of the fun of a game is a hot dog and beer balanced on my lap in my seat hoping not to spill it as I scream for my team. \u00a0The Stadium Club has the balancing act down . . . .it just lacks the \"fun\" of what is on the other side of the glass.", "The food is relatively cheap and accordingly bland and disappointing.The server was nice at least, and probably earned her automatically applied \"service charge\".I wouldn't eat here again.", "The added micro brews was a good call.", "Classy, good food, mixed review on service, expensive!I got stadium club passes with some tickets I purchased off ebay. \u00a0 The club is an exclusive area in the ballpark and looks like a nice private club. \u00a0 I wouldn't want to have to extra to get in though or pay a yearly fee. \u00a0If someone else were taking me or the passes were free/cheap, it is worth checking out.Dining Room:Call to make reservations before the game to guarantee your table is \u00a0available and waiting for you.Food - $29 \"buffet\" where you only get to fill your plate once. \u00a0 The food is high quality for food at the ballpark. \u00a0 It is mediocre food when comparing to a nice restaurant or a place that can charge $30 for a plate. \u00a0 Contrary to what another reviewer says, I don't think food here is as good as a high cost / high quality hotel buffet. \u00a0If you don't care about dollars or have someone else treating, this is worth checking out. \u00a0 If you like regular ballpark food and want to save a few dollars, don't eat here!The landslide ice cream pie I had for dessert fed four of us and we still had some left over. \u00a0 It is huge and looks intimidating. \u00a0 It was good though.Service- They tack on a 18% service charge automatically so beware you are not tipping extra by accident. \u00a0 The server I had on my one visit here was a bit pushy and rubbed me the wrong way with multiple comments. \u00a0 One of my dining companions felt the same way and neither of us is easily offended.Bar:The bar is an extra level up from the restaurant. \u00a0 It has lots of tables and sandwiches for ~10. \u00a0 I didn't get to try the sandwiches because I was stuffed from the restaurant buffet downstairs, but next time I come, I will try one of the juicy looking sandwiches.I did have a drink at the bar and took advantage of their free bar snack mix. \u00a0 The bartender was also very friendly and attentive.", "Service - TerribleTable - wiped if off with a dirty ragFood - TerribleBurger was like a burnt hockey puck. \u00a0Asked for a new burger, and it took an additional 20 minutes? \u00a0Why, they just gave me another burger that was cooked hours earlier and sat under a heat lamp. \u00a0The tiny pretzel bun.....you've got to be kidding me.You'd think that the fans that can afford to be in the Stadium Club would at least have some class.....nope. \u00a0Listening to grown men talk like high school kids, what a joke.The server brought the wrong beers both times. \u00a0The second time she didn't even want to go back to the bar to replace a Bud with a Bud Light. \u00a0What a bad attitude. \u00a02 crappy burgers, 1 crappy turkey burger and 1 beef sandwich with chips, 8 beers......our bill was over $90. \u00a0Unless we get 'free' passes again, I can't see any reason to return here.....I guess when you don't have any restaurants within walking distance, this is what people have to settle for if they want to eat before the game."], "rest_types": ["Sports Bars,", "American (Traditional)"], "price_range": "$11-30", "score": 3.323529411764706, "name": "Stadium Club at US Cellular Field"}, "m1cHRygkVEopvM_XLusJ9g": {"long": -87.6099167, "lat": 41.8092584, "price_index": "$", "hours": {"Mon": {"open": "7:00 am", "close": "6:00 pm"}, "Wed": {"open": "7:00 am", "close": "6:00 pm"}, "Tue": {"open": "7:00 am", "close": "6:00 pm"}, "Thu": {"open": "7:00 am", "close": "6:00 pm"}, "Fri": {"open": "7:00 am", "close": "6:00 pm"}, "Sat": {"open": "9:00 am", "close": "4:00 pm"}, "Sun": {"open": "Closed", "close": "Closed"}}, "comments": ["My cousin convinced me to stop and it was more than I expected.

I mentioned my displeasure with the owner over a year ago and after visiting today recognize that nothing has changed. The menu is large and the food is decent but the staff that works there is pretty rude and nasty with customers. Never a friendly smile or even a thank you. I gave them another chance today and had several questions since the menu has changed. The woman with the tattoos covering her arms and body moaned out loud as I asked questions about the menu which is very confusing. She asked me why did I get in line if I wasn't ready to order?? LOL..Sorry to bother you before placing a $20 order. While waiting for my orders, I witnessed \u00a0Ms.Tattoo and the older woman in the front eating openly behind the front counter while serving food and touching money in front of customers and the owner. I attempted to discuss with the owner, but she blew me off. Either way, this establishment appears to care little about customer service or sanitation.

Yesterday they messed up my delivery order THREE times but as a result, I got two free meals.

The salad was phenomenal!! The ingredients were fresh, and they give you a nice quantity of them (they're not skimpy on the ingredients). And the chicken breast is even seasoned, it's not bland! Plus the hot bacon vinegarette dressing is ridiculous! ! Has real bacon pieces in it! I don't like to spend a lot on salads, but from time to time this one will definitely be worth it.

However the lemonades are awesome a little extra sweet though!! I recommend this place!! I would have given 5 stars but the brown skinned lady who works behind the counter is rude rude rude. I think she is the owner too. I have always seen how she never smiles. Heck she just isn't that pleasant. The short dark skinned women is always very nice. I only ordered a large lemonade and the owner took FOREVER to make my beverage. The short dark skinned women was going to make it but she told her to do something else. The owner took a phone order, started wiping down \u00a0the area around the lemonade container and went in the back to do something. I understand she has things to do but it only takes 2 mins to put lemonade in a cup. Fixing a customers extremely small order should be priority!!

I ordered a thin crust cheese pizza, so I was expecting thin crust pizza. Instead, the crust was quite thick almost soft--not at all the thin and crispy I had in mind when I ordered it. Both the sauce and the crust were bland and flavorless. There was too much cheese and, though melted, it would have been improved if it had had five minutes longer in the oven. Someone else ordered a BBQ beef sandwich and was not too impressed. He ate about half and then threw the rest away instead of keeping it as leftovers. Maybe I'm being overly critical in giving Cholie's two stars, but I have standards when it comes to pizza and I have eaten a LOT of pizza throughout Chicago. The quality of pizza left a lot to be desired, but the price was right. I'm not sure how Cholie's compares to other pizza joints around Hyde Park (or if there even are any at all), but sitting among all the other pizzas I've tried, Cholie's is a solid two stars, bordering on three.

What we found was the most comprehensive, reasonable wedding package we had seen. It's all on their website and Megan, the on-site coordinator, was professional, knowledgable, and so so sweet. From the moment we walked in, we knew it was THE place. We rented the entire second floor of the venue and reserved all 17 guest rooms on the third floor for our family and friends to stay in. The Quad Club already has tables, chairs, linens, alcohol, and full-service catering. Even better, they don't have a restrictive vendor list so you can bring in your own cake, florist, DJ, etc. as long as they have the proper insurance.The food was great! We had choices of braised short rib, chicken, or gnocchi and got several compliments on all the dishes. We chose the basic 3 hour open bar and our guests were plenty satisfied and toasted by the end of the night. The staff was super friendly and set up all the rooms exactly as requested. The venue is beautiful as is, but when I walked down the stairs for the ceremony, it had transformed into my personal dream wedding space like magic! The guest rooms are homey and spacious.

This time around I had the quiche which was somewhat bland and under salted.Still a solid dining experience on campus however.", "I'm staying here for one night, and have had a mixed experience. Since the building is so old, the amenities in the room look very rundown, the TV does not work, and finding/using the electrical plugs in the room is a hassle", "We had our wedding ceremony and reception at the Quadrangle Club last month, and it was a fantastic experience from the start of the planning process to the moment the last guest left the reception. We worked with Megan to plan the day, and she was so helpful with answering questions, scheduling tours and tastings, and being our day-of point person for vendor arrivals. Multiple guests commented that the food was the best food they'd ever had at a wedding! The building itself is elegant and well-preserved, and the campus grounds provided a beautiful backdrop for photos. Some of my family stayed in the guest rooms upstairs, which are extremely charming (but also definitely 'vintage' - which we all happened to like). For a beautiful, unique wedding venue, I can't recommend the Quad Club strongly enough!", "This private club is not just for faculty and staff of the University of Chicago. It is open to the Hyde Park community as well. They have three well-maintained Har-Tru clay tennis courts, and new outdoor furniture. There are a variety of tennis lessons for adults and children, and as I rank somewhere in-between, I may write more about that soon!The three-story clubhouse is a welcoming place on the University of Chicago campus. The lounge is home to lively academic (and not so academic) conversations over drinks. Upstairs, is the main dining room and private meeting rooms.Dining, the reason most of you will have contact here. Executive chef Chris Turano is a great addition, the food used to taste bland and uninspired in years past. Some of the vegetables are from the garden right next to the clubhouse, how's that for fresh?The library is a place nearby to read, relax, or have a private conversation, and I've taken a short nap or two sitting on the sofa. Further upstairs, there are 17 guest rooms that were recently renovated, but they still retain some of the \"charm\" they had previously.", "If you search Quadrangle Club at the University of Chicago on a Google search you will most likely hit the article toting Chef Chris Turano, who has unfortunately left this establishment for greener pastures. My taste buds have enjoyed his work up until his departure in 2011. In 2012, there was a noticeable change in the kitchen. The quality of the food has declined as well as the flavors. I am surprised and dumb-founded by the recent reviews because I have experienced both catered and normal service to be poor. At a catered departmental event, an entree choice was delivered in the form of three flat falafels, 2 inches in diameter that were completely bland. The only edible part of the meal were two broccoli florets that actually saw some salt. Out of starvation you have to consume the brick that is a dinner roll, the 5-leaf boxed salad with a generous lone cherry tomato, and the chocolate cake. Can't tell you if the chocolate cake was actually good because anything tastes good when you're starving. Most recently, I accompanied an emeritus professor to lunch at the Quad Club hoping for better and receiving disappointment once again. I have learned to keep it simple because who can mess up simple, what food establishment is going to risk poor pasta? The Quad Club that is! Fettucine is pasta in sauce with some vegetables. What I receive is gluten mush because the pasta is overcooked, and terrible sauce. The oil had started to separate from the rest of the sauce. The vegetables again overcooked. At least I tasted something, but it was so forgettable that I can't tell you what that flavor was. For an establishment that conveys exclusivity and pretentiousness, please execute, because I too can lay down a white table cloth, pour an Arnold Palmer, and microwave a frozen dinner to achieve my experiences at The Quad Club.", "I held my wedding reception at the Quadrangle Club, and I was quite pleased. \u00a0My husband sampled the food prior to the wedding as was not impressed. \u00a0I was a bit nervous because I really wanted the venue since we were getting married at Bond Chapel. \u00a0Fortunately, the food for the wedding was great!

Yikes! It allowed us to get ahead of the traffic and get set up. \u00a0The venue is beautiful and classic. \u00a0I would recommend that they choose a wider variety of wines, and a better quality wine list.", "My wedding reception was held here, and my husband and I have gotten reports that it was a wonderful night. \u00a0So despite a few issues, in the end everything paid off.The place is perfect for the low maintenance couple because they take care of quite a bit for you. \u00a0They do the meal and bar, they do furniture and furniture coverings, they have a contractor that does the cake so you can take care of all of these aspects at the club. \u00a0Just come in a couple of times, have some tastes and make some choices. \u00a0We held our cocktail hour in the cozy library, our 150 person dinner in the main dining room, and the pool table lounge downstairs was open at no extra charge for the kids and teenagers who needed just a little space from their partying parents.The small issues occurred in the planning phases - my sister, who was pretty much managing most of my wedding planning, had some scheduling and communication weirdness with the coordinator. \u00a0It was all resolved in the end though. \u00a0Then one face-scruncher was the issue of chairs - they tell you upfront that chair covers and other cloth items cost extra. \u00a0What they don't tell you is that you're pretty much gonna have to have chair covers and \"extras\" because the chairs are old and kind of ugly.But. \u00a0Okay, you pony up for the chair covers and you square everything away in advance. \u00a0What matters is the guests enjoy themselves, and the apps were hearty, the meals were yummy, and the drinks were flowing. \u00a0The cake was soft, sweet and tasty. \u00a0Many of my guests left full and tipsy, so IMO a successful evening.", "My husband and I were here for a wedding reception a couple of weekends ago -- it was a lovely space (although I totally slipped on the tile in my high heels) and the food was great. \u00a0It was also directly across the street from the church, which was very convenient since we were visiting Chicago without a car. \u00a0They served appetizers and wine in the library (I agree with Victor -- a very cozy room!), and both were excellent. \u00a0We didn't know a lot of people there, and we're kinda shy, so my husband \u00a0& I ended up browsing the books rather than socializing, which was very entertaining. :-)The main dinner was held in the banquet room, which was wood-paneled and warm-feeling. \u00a0The service was great, and the dinner was delicious. \u00a0The highlight for me was the steak -- it's not often that you go to a dinner for 50 people and get a piece of steak that's still juicy and pink in the middle... normally everything is a little over-cooked when \u00a0you're serving food to a large group.", "We held our wedding, cocktail hour, and reception at the Quad Club on June 1, 2013, and had a wonderful experience. \u00a0Michelle and Trelinda were great to work with, which was especially reassuring because I was organizing from our home in New York. \u00a0We and our immediate families stayed in rooms on-site as well, and they were wonderful. \u00a0Catering was great, all the rooms and decoration were elegant and beautiful, coordination (with the help of our day-of coordinator) was seamless, and the prices were very reasonable. \u00a0Highly recommend.", "I really like this place.

Fried banana.The lemongrass lime drink reminded me of lemonade without a bag of sugar for sweetening. The thin layer of minded shrimp in the deep-fried wonton sheets wasn't enough to fill you up, but the flavour was definitely enough to make you want more. The chicken green curry was outstanding. I was glad I ordered it instead of a traditional pho. And the fried banana for dessert was even more satisfying with vanilla cream than I imagined it would have been with honey.Pho 55 is not crowded like the Vietnamese restaurants along the Argyle Avenue stretch in Uptown.

The service is quick, which is nice if you're on a tight schedule. While the pho was not the best I've ever had, it satisfied my craving for pho. Also, the beef was rare, not already cooked.

I guess it is a standard vietamese menu. The phos are very good, in particular the beef one. Also the fish plates are nice. I like the shrimp one in particular.

As is their yellow curry. Their healthier menu items are also tasty, like the lotus root salad, garlic noodles and obviously their pho (though a little pricier).

The server was polite and apologetic, however I suggest going down the street to Chicago's Home of Chicken and Waffles for consistent, fresh soul food.", "After an disappointing experience at Priscilla's in Hillside, I recalled my encounter with Pearl's Place in the Grand Boulevard neighborhood back in July 2013. \u00a0At that time I didn't officially join Yelp. \u00a0You know what? \u00a0I want to do Pearl's Place an honor this time because I want to recommend this place to my fellow yelpers. \u00a0If you want some southern food that can bless your body, mind, and soul in the city, my pick would be the Pearl's Place on Michigan and Pershing. \u00a0After parking our vehicle at the Amber Inn (a partner business) parking lot, our journey to the best soul food in the city began. \u00a0The entire place ran like a well-oiled machine. \u00a0We were taken care by Ms. Liz, who was one of the most professional, easy-going, and systematic servers we have ever met. \u00a0We forwent the lunch buffet ($13/person) and ordered a la carte instead. \u00a0My shrimp and cheesy grits with bacons and green onions was soul-fulfilling! \u00a0I've been craving for shrimp and grits (one of my favorite southern-food specialities) for quite some time. \u00a0The shrimps were cleaned thoroughly and de-tailed; there was a balanced amount of \"melt ability\" between cheese and grits. \u00a0I was so glad that I satiated my crave this afternoon. \u00a0Hubby also had a quality catfish sandwich. \u00a0Liz kindly informed him that the Brussels sprouts weren't available, yet he could have a choice of another side. \u00a0Hubby then received a cup of rice with gravy. \u00a0By the way, their coleslaw and gravy were quite delicious as well. \u00a0The adjacent patrons went with the lunch buffet option. \u00a0I would say it's worth the price if you come hungry. \u00a0One of the unique features at Pearl's Place is that the chefs behind the buffet bar serve each plate for you. \u00a0Trust me, every plate is filled to its full-capacity and will make you \"incapacitate\" (hopefully in a good way) after several plates from the buffet bar. \u00a0I know some reviewers have mentioned the surroundings and the neighborhood itself. \u00a0Yes, it's a \"bare-looking\" neighborhood, but I feel fine walking on the streets from and to the train station (CTA Indiana Green line station is in a very close proximity) during day-time. \u00a0Nevertheless, free parking is more than sufficient at the Amber Inn lot. \u00a0Come as you are! \u00a0Overall, we spent $20 (not including tax and tip) and our stomaches were \"soul-ly\" happy. \u00a0Give Pearl's a try, and let me know what you think.", "After Thanksgiving food cravings led me to Pearls! I am so happy to have found this place esp. since it's a short commute from Hyde Park! Pros: Food, location, staffCons: no parking, currently doesn't sell alcoholic beverages but apparently that's changing soon, also the Jumbo Wings were huge but I steer away from chemically modified meat as I don't think quantity should supersede quality \u00a0 Overall I would def. return", "We really enjoyed ourselves. The good was pretty good. Compared to McArthers I would go here for a more authentic try at soul food. (Not saying I won't go back to MA).The service was good. Our waiter had some good one liners that were very appropriate and made the experience more personalized.!", "This is one of the best kept secrets on the south side. The fried chicken wings are good but the biscuits and corn bread are the hot topic on this menu. The buffet is affordable and delicious. Breakfast is available all day! This is like a family place and the waig staff is attentive.", "The food was good. \u00a0I personally wasn't blown away but it was A-OK. \u00a0I was impressed with the buffet set-up. \u00a0There are servers to fix your plate. \u00a0There is a nice germ shield glass that separates the public from the food. \u00a0You just tell them what you want and they pile it on. Now this is a buffet I can frequent!", "Awesome low-key comfort food. We had the breakfast buffet, well worth the $11. The chef and waitress were genuinely friendly and gave excellent service. The manager helped the chef out when the orders piled up and also went around to each table asking how everyone's breakfast was. The biscuits were the best part!!", "Quick take: a very solid southern style brunch, will \u00a0return. Pearls offers lots of yummy foods like biscuits, fluffy pancakes and waffles, and crispy bacon. But the fried chicken is a clear winner - we went back to the breakfast buffet for 5 rounds and left a little chicken graveyard at the table. Also, I don't know if comments pertaining to poor service are still relevant (at least for brunch). We've been twice and had great, courteous service both times!", "The husband and I have been here twice during the week for a late breakfast. We arrived in time for the changeover to the buffet from the breakfast seating.Pearl's Place has very good grits, good biscuits, good soft scrambled eggs, an egg white option, very good coffee, and very good sweet potato pie with a somewhat tougher crust than my mother made. When you are seated you are given a cute oval very good not too sweet pan cornbread to share. The food offerings appear to be basic own home would food. The buffet had two kinds of greens, omelettes made to order, but was a steeper price at $13 than we wanted to pay not including beverages or all of the wonderful southern dessert options. The husband, in general, is opposed to cafeteria style serving as am I given my experience as a server whilst in undergrad! Something about obviously made ahead food is less appealing to us.Jasmine G and Vonja give friendly, menu knowledgeable, customer-oriented service. \u00a0In general all staff are very helpful and hospitable.Pearl's Place is undergoing a remodel whilst still in business. \u00a0The decor reflects the history of jazz, Bronzeville, and is interestingly eclectic and obviously the items on the walls come from a collection accumulated through the years. I will enjoy seeing what the remodel update brings, but I hope it includes a more aesthetically pleasing display of the artifacts on the walls today with perhaps an expansion of the collection with labels telling the history of each item! I've taken the time to look at them and I like and enjoy them.Pearl's Place provides good comfort soul food and breakfast in a shabby environment with excellent customer service. I recommend it if you are in the neighborhood, but until after the remodel is complete, cannot suggest making a special trip to try.Free parking in lot shared with co-located hotel. No validation is required during the week.", "Nice place for a home cooked meal and relaxed atmosphere! \u00a0Reminds me of lunch at the 5 and Dine with my grandma! \u00a0First time I stopped here but won't be my last! \u00a0Being from North Dakota this is my first true southern style buffet and I loved it......Selection was huge.", "Cornbread: greatDirty rice: spectacular Greens: amazingCabbage: absolutely wonderful Catfish nuggets: pretty much perfect!Jerk ribs: mine were a little dry, but sauce was tasty!Candied Yams: scrumptious Mac & cheese: TO DIE FOR!!!!!

I've had a few of their sandwiches (I believe a Roast Beef, Sumac Chicken, and Garlic Chicken) and nothing has disappointed. I would definitely recommend getting your sandwich with the Crunch bread (I'm forgetting the exact name of it) but it's delightful! If you're hard-pressed to make a decision among the vast choices (many veggie and vegan options, too!), the owner will happily give his recommendations.Out of all the development Hyde Park has been going through in the past few years, Cafe 53 is one of only three places that I believe is worth repeatedly visiting.Go there. Now. Seriously.", "Cute little cafe with various pastries, sandwiches and quiches. I tried the little desserts, veggie panini, and mint lemonade drink.

It's part coffee shop, part gelateria, and part restaurant that delivers! They do everything.. And for the most part they do it well. \u00a0The food options vary from the boring (grilled chicken salad) to unique international (I had some middle eastern chicken sandwich that was AMAZING).

I recommend eating there so you can get it delivered to you fresh after preparation as (especially the vegetarian/vegan ones) some of the sandwiches get a bit sloppy quickly with the dressings and such soaking into the bread. I, personally, love their eggplant sandwiches. They are quite large and very filling. No real options for sides for those who want some fries or something with their order, but you can get some chips. If you're in the mood for gelato... oh man! They have some great, original flavor options. I tried a scoop of basil with a scoop of ricotta - which had a great cheesecake taste to it when combined. The server just kept providing me sample after sample with various combos to see what I might like. So many yummy options - I could hardly decide.", "Most underrated cafe in Hyde Park.

I would have given a higher rating if they could have managed to deliver the food that I actually ordered. They got the delivery order wrong not once, but twice! How does that happen? They did comp the last order but it was wrong too! Part of the order was correct. I ate the salad but all of the mix-ups was exasperating. I'll move on to other places to order as trying to get a correct order took up way too much of my time.", "The owner, who is almost always there, is very personable, and will knock himself out to make you happy. The coffee is way better than Starbucks and way way better than DD. Recently, the menu was expanded. Meat lovers, as well as veggies will be happy. I like the Eggplant Meatball, as well as their \"Caf\u00e9 53 Sandwich\" - which is a simple bagel with egg whites, covered in delicious Turkish olive oil, and sprinkled with mint.

I was too damned hungry to play and say anything other than ok, although I had come prepared with steak n shake coupons before I knew where we were headed. 2. I don't like these places. I don't like faux meat. Awww man. :/ We arrived and this quaint little spot that sits on a corner in Chicago was black owned and inviting. The chandaliers gave a soulful glam to the dining area and the line of people on the side where the salads and homemade ice cream are served stayed full. I scanned the menu looking for something that did NOT contain the faux meat. I settled on a noodle veggie plate. It was FIYAH! FIRE! GREAT ! As in gooooood! Yes, I was starving which means there was a small possibility that it wasn't as good as I thought it was. But that's not true. It was really quite delicious....there wasn't a 'sauce', but the noodles and veggies (onions, sundried tomatoes, spinach & mushrooms) had been tossed in ginger and probably some type of sesame and olive oil combination. I ate until I could not eat anymore and not to be wasteful, I took the small leftovers home. The plate was huge and anyone can get full from half a serving. I didn't like the flavor of the water. It tasted like it was flavored with lemon but came from a busted up, unfiltered pipe that has an attitude towards clean water. But the food was amazing. I would definitely go back and have this again. I might even try the greens they offered and there was also another veggie plate that read like it would cure my hunger pains as well. \u00a0The service was cool, the waitress was friendly and helpful and the hallway that leads to the bathroom is decorated full of vintage photos of famous (and even non-famous) people. It's a welcoming atmosphere. The guests seemed happy and peaceful and by the time we left, my stomach was in agreeance.

Yes, my heart broke into a million little pieces but I took it as a sign to expand my horizons.

The camp was being held at MSI nearby, and I was going to be the runner to pick up the subs. Unexpectedly, the camp needed more staff to watch the kids so I called Subway desperately seeing if there could be a delivery made last minute. This would have been a no in most situations during busy lunch hours, especially when the delivery was not planned ahead of time.

I will be back for sure.", "wanted to try something new.. so instead of going for bbq pork.. i went with bbq turkey just to see how different it is! hahai ordered the turkey tips/ link combo and the fried turkey ribs. it is something different and need time to get used to haha.. but i am not a fan at all for their bbq sauce..it doesnt have that kick to it like most places.. it was sweetish..sourish? the meat on the turkey ribs falls right off the bone and is tender.. some of the turkey tips are very chewy.. \u00a0the links was very salty.. also it came with fries but was eh.. i didnt like their bbq sauce and all my food was drenched in it so that really killed it for me.. maybe ill come back and try their turkey burger or something..", "The turkey tips are delicious.

This is the worst customer service I have evert experienced in my life. I placed an order for 2 turkey hot links, my husband picked them up. I bite into the link and it was so hard, as if it had been sitting out and microwaved to make hot or it was overcooked. I could not even chew it because it was so tough. I immediately called and spoke with the young lady, she relayed the message to her manager and he stated, they would not be giving us another turkey link because the links had been cooked today and that if we wanted I could come back tomorrow and get a turkey tip. I don't eat turkey tips, I like turkey links. I asked the young lady could I speak with the manager and she said NO! I'm relaying the message. Very Rude! I then stated I would bring the food back to get my money and she said ok! (Rude) \u00a01 minute later I get a phone call and it's her saying \" my manager want to know if you bringing the food back!\" I will not be sad or surprised when this place closes down!! 90% of restaurants don't make it, you all have BAD FOOD and BAD SERVICE which is not a winning combo.If you want old warmed up food, with a side of nasty attitude, then this is your place!

It's clean but bare in furniture they could make it appear more welcoming but it serves it's purpose. Grab and go, the one in Evanston for some odd reason beacons you to sit and eat.

By the time my order was ready she gave me the food without saying have a nice day, thanks, bye or nothing besides a bad attitude.

Jerk Turkey Salad, Turkey Wrap, Turkey Nachos, Turkey Ribs, Turkey Tips, Turkey Spaghetti, TURKEY, TURKEY, TURKEY.Now as a gal that is one of the forgotten when it comes to meat, this place did not disappoint. I split a small order of turkey tips and fries with a friend and an order of turkey nachos (ground turkey). You might as well have carried us out! Everything was delicious and the service was fantastic. The lady asked if it was our first time and let me try the turkey tips. WINNING! Now what makes all of this even more fantastic - the BBQ sauce. We tried to buy some but it won't be available until June I think.So the next time I go, I'm going to ask if I can build my own nachos or at least ask for some BBQ on the side. My nachos would look as such: Chips, Cheese, BBQ, Turkey Tips, and all the other goodness of toppings.

I was a little afraid of it being too salty because that's been my experience with other turkey products like turkey bacon for example. Fortunately that was not the case.

The tonkatsu is crispy on the outside and usually juicy and tender on the inside. Out of the many times I've ordered this, it was only overcooked once. Out of the sushi roll, I definitely like the Kikuya roll the most since it feels like it has the greatest amount of fish. Their -dons are really good too; I would recommend the unagi don if that's what you're looking for. The udon is also very good, especially for the cold Chicago winters.

Their price is a little more than Lawrence fish market for maki rolls by around 50-75 cents each roll, but I guess they're trying to cover the cost of good ambiance. We also had some seaweed and the octopus dish as an appetizer, which I thought was kind of overpriced, cause I can get the same quality of seaweed in flushing for about 2 dollars and a lot more of it whereas here, it costs 4.50 for a smaller portion. Their specialty soda was 2.50 a pop which is 1.25x more expensive than you'll get in a flushing supermarket. But otherwise it's a pretty good restaurant.

Not sure why no one else was offended...Now what I know that food will pick up those smells as a flavor... So I just grabbed a menu and left... Don't think I'll return given the reviews posted", "I heard a lot of good things about this restaurant from my co-workers. So I decided to give them a try...I mean how can you go wrong with wings. \u00a0Well, guess what...it went way wrong.First, I went around 2pm in the afternoon on a Monday and when I first walked in there it was empty except for two guys and a girl talking and hanging out. Something told me that one of the gentleman was the owner because there was no one at the cash register and it didn't appear that anyone was in the back cooking. Sure enough one of the guys walks over to the cash register and says what can I get you. I told him it was my first time there and asked if he had any recommendations. \u00a0He suggested the bbq wings and I also ordered the lemon pepper wings. Upon getting home and looking at my wings. I immediately noticed that the lemon pepper wings looked dry and over cooked. I also notice the different proportions of the wings. It was also evident that the wings were not fresh. Not sure where they buy their wings from but you could tell it was not quality. The bbq wings were ok but the chicken was tough and fried too hard. It was horrible. I will never go back. With so many great places to buy wings, there's no reason to visit this place. I'm not sure how this place got so many good reviews. \u00a0Maybe there was a different cook when I went but I was just not impressed.", "The wings are great, I had the honey bar b q jerk, service was good. its a lot of things only the menu I would love to try. only thing is the guy that took my order overcharged me waaay too much on the tax..or instance the taffy grapes are 4.00 he charged me 5.00 a whole also on the chicken...bro need to brush up his skills on sales tax..", "Best wings in town!!! Working my way through the flavors, 10 down and looking forward the rest.I usually phone my order in, and when I get there 15 minutes later, it's ready! But if I had to wait around a few minutes I wouldn't mind. The place has a relaxed atmosphere.", "EAT HERE IF YOU LOVE WINGS. Their flavors are really creative. The straw-Q \u00a0and the Honey Jerk are so far my favorite. I plan to go back very soon to try more. Be mindful they only accept cash. Also the only suggestion I have is to bring back the Greek and Italian options and to update the website. But the wings are hot and saucy and the fries are seasoned well.", "Everything is made to order which is great but I was expecting something else. I was looking to get a fried wing smothered in some type of sauce like traditional buffalo or teriyaki wings. What I got was a fried wing with seasoning sprinkled on top of it. The mild sauce was a disgrace to Chicago's Mild sauce as it was just a spicy barbecue sauce. However now that I know what to expect I would visit again as the wings were fried to perfection, really crispy with a fluffiness to them.", "By far one of my favorite wing spots. They have a plethora of flavor a here. \u00a0Definitely make sure you check out the CWAW Flavors. I had the Honey Lemon Pepper and the Jerk Honey BBQ wings. I promise you that I had to inspect my bone again to make sure I didn't leave anything left on there. Full of flavor and fried slightly hard. \u00a0Very small establishment, so don't blink because you may miss it. \u00a0I wish I could order their \u00a0wings from Nashville because I would eat them all the time. Make sure you stop here when you come to Chicago.", "The atmosphere is great. Restaurant was definitely clean. No complaints, you should definitely try this place out.", "There was a $10 for $20 deal on yelp, so I came here with two friends over the weekend. The surrounding neighborhood is pretty rough, so I would recommend driving over to the restaurant. (We took the 4 bus here and walked two blocks -- have never seem my friend walk so fast in my life. Ended up uber-ing it back). They were filming for some sort of TV show or movie when we arrived, which was pretty cool. The service here is great -- we ordered two sets of 10 pc wings (garlic parm, honey bbq, banging spicy, and jalapeno). The honey bbq one was my favorite. The spicy had a real kick to it. All the wings I had were very delicious and flavorful. I would definitely recommend getting two contrasting flavors (e.g. one sweet, one spicy) to get a fuller experience here. While we were waiting for our wings, one of the workers here brought us out a cup of grapes lightly coated with peanuts and caramel. This gesture was very much appreciated! These little fellows were delish! If they are on the menu, you have to try them.Service is great here so this wasn't really a problem for us, but I can imagine that during busier hours it would be useful to have a napkin dispenser on each table since the wings are so messy.", "If you know me you know I love wings and every wing is not treated equally. \u00a0I believe this is some of the best freshly cook made to order chicken wings I have tasted in a long time.When we first heard of this place we drove to the old location and if we had only walked down a little more we would have seen the new location, so if you see on Yelp or Google that Chicago Wingz Around the World is closed its the 510 E 75th \u00a0location and the new one is 557 E 75th right on the corner.When we first stepped in we could see the place was clean and the aroma of the wings filled the restaurant. \u00a0If you think you are just going to see your typical wings you are mistaken they have flavors like Parmesan Garlic(d'lish), Jerk Q, Cheesy Buffalo and Jerk Teriyaki to name a few. \u00a0I believe they have about 40 different flavors to choose from so you could go everyday and still have something new.What I really loved about this chicken is it had the right kind of crunch on the outside and moisture in the inside. \u00a0You can get ten wings (halves) w/fries for $9.95 and two flavors so it allows you to taste more than one flavor. I sprinkled some of my Parmesan cheese on my Jerk Q and I was in heaven the cheese cooled down some of the heat from Jerk and also gave it a bit of a pop in flavor on my dancing taste buds.The owner was cool and it seems like the regulars really like him and we can see why because he was very nice and answered all of our questions about the different flavors that he created.I like that on Monday you can get the wingz for .50 each. On Tuesday they have a wingz challenge and if you can eat their hotess wingz they will give you up to $50 dollars depending on how many wingz you eat.(Now I don't know how long this deal is going to last but it was going on when I was last there.) \u00a0Another thing that makes this owner stand out is that on Sunday from 12-2 they have a homeless special where they give out free wingz. This tells me that the owner is a blessing to many and we should bless him with business so that he may continue giving back to the community.They no longer serve the salad he told us because it wasn't really selling along with the homemade Sweet Tea. \u00a0I kept thinking bring back the Sweet Tea...lolThe second time we went back we ended up eating there and the owner came over to our table making sure everything was okay with our food and he also told us that if we would have let him know we were eating there he would have put our food on a real plate. \u00a0It was fun listening to the other customers talk about sports I forgot how animated men can get when they are passionate about their team.They also have a deal on Yelp which is similar to Groupon $10 for $20 another way you can save and taste those \u00a0Amazing Wingz. \u00a0Trust me you won't be disappointed!!I will definitely be back! \u00a0Enjoy!", "I I don't eat chicken but they have colossal \u00a0shrimp with the ginger barbecue sauce that's fire!! I'm \u00a0a Yelp person and they had rave reviews so I brought my daughter here. It smelled so good in there. They have at least 34 flavors for wings. Didn't even know this spot was over here. Very clean establishment and friendly. Glad to support .", "Guess who's back!!!!It hurt my heart to learn the original location closed last year and once I heard they reopened in a new location I was ecstatic! Me and some friends decided to have a gathering to celebrate the return of WATW! We ordered 100 wings for pickup.Once we got there, I noticed they have a bigger space as now you can sit inside whereas before you always had to get your food to go as there wasn't any sitting space. There are also flat screens on the wall to catch some good TV while you smash some delicious wings. They have also diversified the menu a bit as they now offer chicken sandwiches, chicken tenders, salads, chicken & waffles as well as some fried seafood.The favorites are still here as you can still get Strawberry BBQ, Sweet Ginger BBQ, Cheesy Buffalo, Maple, Jerk-Q among others. We put a damn hurting on them wings as there were pretty much none left once we finished. Good to see these guys are back on 75th.", "The Jerk Chicken tacos were so good. I ordered two tacos but I was full after the first one.", "Their wings are ssoooooo good, esp the hot ones because they definitely are hot.. I want to try the jumbo shrimp & maybe the jerk tacos, nachos or fries on my next visit", "Great food and the owner is wonderful great attitude i will be going back and i will tell everyone i know to go there and eat very satisfied customer.", "IThe staff in this restaurant are terrible. They were not polite nor were they friendly. The person at the counter never said may I help you nor did he say thank you or come again. He acted as if I was a bother. He said they were whole wings. They were not. They are more expensive than any other chicken establishment in the area. I chose them to support my people. \u00a0My people treated me like s***. I had three different types. The buffalo wings were the only ones that were tasty. I will never visit this restaurant again. I would not suggest it to anyone.", "This honestly is probably the best place I've had as far as wings go. I got the Garlic and Cheesy Buffalo wings. So damn good. \u00a0I am a wing fanatic that has ate at wing spots all over the us. This has got to be one of the best I've had. \u00a0 Staff was cool too.", "My first visit to the new location. Again it is a little bit east of the old place. The new location is brighter and has sit down tables and they also carry soft drinks.You know the routine. The pricing goes in batches of six. I usually stick to the more popular items (cheesy buffalo, jerk, bourbon). My favorites are the garlicky ones with big pieces of garlic all over them. Yum.There's some construction on 75th. There was a Yelp deal available but I don't mind paying full price because I noticed that they are involved in the community and provide free meals to the homeless on Sundays.", "Delicious homemade sauces.

The owner/chef is Paulette who is a sweetheart and will take good care of you. There's a single table which is more for waiting than eating. They do accept credit cards. Dinners consisting of meat, beans & rice plus two sides typically run under $10 bucks while the seafood dishes are a little more. The portions are very generous. Metra trains run down the middle of 71st Street so pay heed to the \"Yield\" signs which are all over the place here.Of course the jerk chicken is the dish to get. I have a weakness for curry, so I got some of that to go also. The dinners are served on a generous bed of rice and beans and come with two sides. For one side I got steamed cabbage. Paulette works her magic even on the lowly cabbage which is seasoned to culinary nirvana.Oxtails. Curried goat. Talk about authentic! They even had escoviched fish on the menu which is akin to a ceviche.

Then I got the jerk chicken and figured you can't go wrong with this. WRONG this was even worse than the curry chicken. The jerk chicken tasted like the rotisserie chicken you'd buy from Costco. It tastes great if rotisserie chicken was what I ordered. I ordered jerk chicken and there wasn't a thing jerk about that chicken. The rice was still dry and tasteless, with just extra gravy poured on it. I had to re-season and re-cook the whole meal over.

I called the deli back and I stated that I asked for plain and the man on the phone responded by saying that I did say that I wanted cheese on my sandwich. He said that when he confirmed the order back to me over the phone, he asked if I wanted cheese, and I said yes. I never said \"yes,\" to anything. He never even confirmed the order to me. I do not appreciate being treated as if I was a liar! He went on saying that I called in the order as a carry out. I told him no and that I never called in the order as a carryout. I then reminded him who I was by telling him the color of the shirt I had on. He said that he remembered me because he knows that I come in often. I am a regular at this deli. I live down the street, and I do come in there a few times a month and I order the same thing. He then stated that they don't make mistakes twice and that there was just a misunderstanding. However, he did make a mistake because he thought I was someone else. He never took responsibility for his actions. He claimed that I said yes to the cheese and that I ordered carry out. Lastly, he asked if I can come back and he can either give me a new sandwich or my money back. I stated that I wanted my money back and that I will not come back for the third time in a row. I asked if he could write my name on a ticket and then I will be back tomorrow to get my money. He said ok, but bring back the sandwiches. I questioned him about me having to bring back the sandwiches tomorrow to get my money back. He repeated that I have to bring back the sandwiches to get my money back and then added by saying that he will throw away the sandwiches anyway. I am insulted that I would be asked to walk down the street with a bag of old sandwiches in order to get my money back after they messed up my order! Especially after he acknowledged that he knew me. He recognized that I am a regular. Why would I have to bring back sandwiches to prove that I did not eat them or to prove that I am not trying to run a scam after I've been there 20 times before!! I am highly offended by how I was treated. This deli is infused with poor customer service and is ran by people who do not put costumers first. I did not appreciate having to deal with bad customer service from a person who did not want to take responsibility for anything, and ultimately insulting me by holding my refund hostage until I return two sandwiches (even on the next day). I am appalled that I would be treated like some scam artist off the streets, when I have clearly been there many times before and I have never had a problem.

Also the dimpling need to be closed better i.e. close with less skin on top.", "I wanted to enjoy this place so much more than I did, and I couldn't. The most grievous problem I have with this dumpling restaurant is that it's not a dumpling restaurant. \u00a0It's an otherwise perfectly lovely restaurant that tries to fit its food inside (and around) dumplings. \u00a0I think there's a profound lack of respect and understanding of dumplings as a food item that really limits this place. \u00a0The entire thing is treated as a novelty, as some gimmick for packaging otherwise nice food. \u00a0I realize this sounds like some minor crazy philosophical point, but it matters.1. The fillings were almost all meat. \u00a0This is a mistake. \u00a0Single-filling dumplings are necessarily lacking in their range of flavors-they will feel less filling and satisfying because of it. \u00a0Especially when we're talking two-or-four dumpling portions, this is a huge setback.2. Many of the meats appeared to be precooked, which is an understandable decision: they get to use more interesting meats than would be otherwise possible. \u00a0Moreover, dumplings (hypothetically) allow the delivery of flavors and meats that would otherwise take much longer to cook. \u00a0But when handled badly, the meat ends up being dry and mushy (especially as it has to be chopped down into a filling, losing a lot of structural integrity and mouthfeel). \u00a0It was handled badly.3. Packed's way around this is to use sauces and garnishes and etc. \u00a0First off, isn't this a little backwards? \u00a0To make dumplings better by putting things on top of and around them, rather than inside them? \u00a0Secondly, this makes the entire dumpling project seem more laborious and extraneous. \u00a0If I'm cutting apart a duck dumpling so I can smear it ginger-scallion sauce and pick up scallions, why am I not just eating duck breast in ginger scallion sauce? \u00a0Why am I eating a dumpling instead? \u00a0Thirdly, there's often not enough of these extras/enough strength of flavor to really balance out the uniformity of the meat dumplings. \u00a0My point is not that these extra touches are totally wrong-the plating was often attractive, the sauces were well-made, I enjoyed them-but that they can't save a poorly conceived dumpling. \u00a04. Some of the ideas were just poorly conceived. \u00a0The lobster dumplings were modeled after classic ways of eating lobster, with minimal accompaniment, but the texture and flavor of lobster doesn't keep well enough for that. \u00a0The rice dessert dumpling had a lot of great flavors assembled around it, but the dumpling itself was filled with congealed rice pudding-it very much felt like eating a bread sandwich. \u00a0Silliness.5. The wrapper was honestly not very good, and I don't know if that's because of how long they'd been stored or what. They were a little thick, which is not a bad thing. \u00a0I love thick-skinned dumplings. \u00a0But they were dry, a little flabby (presumably precooked to some degree), and largely tasteless. \u00a0Even the duck dumpling's fancy curry wrapper didn't have nearly enough flavor to add.6. The service was lovely and the food came out lightning fast. \u00a0But food that comes out so fast really makes me question: how long ago was it actually made? \u00a0To what degree was it already precooked? \u00a0I would've been happy to wait five more minutes if it meant that my dumplings would actually be cooked, and taste a little less like they were reheated in a microwave.7. I understand that I might've caught the restaurant on an off day, or perhaps an off hour. \u00a0I imagine all these dumplings would taste much better freshly made (though there would still be some basic issues). \u00a0But we ate there at 6 pm on a Wednesday. \u00a0I know that isn't the most important day of the week for any restaurant, but if you can't expect good food at exactly dinner time, when the hell can you expect it?There were a lot of interesting flavor combinations that I was excited and subsequently disappointed by. My overall impression is that dumplings are being treated as a way to deliver some semblance of fine dining to customers, rather than fine dining being used to elevate dumplings. \u00a0Which is fine, I suppose, but mediocre dumplings are mediocre dumplings even if they're made with locally-sourced ingredients and fancy short ribs; the price just makes it bite even more.It's not all bad news, to be sure. \u00a0I really enjoyed the pozole soup dumpling I had, made with braised shoulder of lamb, peppers, and hominy. \u00a0I was a little skeptical, but it won me over-it was almost like an explosion of a really layered, delicious chili in my mouth. \u00a0(I had some trivial complaints about it, but w/e) \u00a0But I'll note that it succeeds primarily because it goes in the opposite direction of a lot of Packed's dumpling offerings: it packs all the flavors inside the dumpling.I'm running out of space. \u00a0I want this place to succeed so badly! \u00a0Packed does a lot of things right! \u00a0Atmosphere, decor, service, exciting menu changes, seasonality, local relationships, etc. \u00a0It just doesn't do dumplings right, and that's the tragedy.", "Packed Dumplings, and the reviews, bring to light one of the issues on sustainable and healthy eating: it's financially inaccessible to America's working class, in that, as indicated by the prices here for the food and portions. Buying local, organic, non-GMO ingredients is too expensive for anyone to eat often without a 6-figure salary. Presumably this has something to do with government subsidies and farming.If you are poor, it's probably impossible to eat in a way that is 'environmentally friendly' - and it's not your fault - it's just the system that is broken. Thus I don't think Chef Sheerin is to blame for the high prices nor his philosophy of how he acquires ingredients. There seems to be a lot of hate on that, though I will admit it's a bit odd for 4 out of the 5 main dumpling types to be premium-priced vs the other one.Is Hyde Park - a mostly student-filled, and middle class neighborhood - the wrong neighborhood to open a high-end fast casual place? Maybe. But I think if this restaurant had opened elsewhere it wouldn't bring up the same issues on how sustainable farming and class intersect.Now onto the food... yes, it's expensive. I'm very small and my lunch special was just on the cusp of being filling. My meal was around $14 and that was with not buying any of the special dumplings. I don't imagine I would go here for anything other than special occasions. I definitely think - and this might be how the place was marketed - this place is trying to make 'dining as entertainment' available to a wider audience. I'm still not really sold on 'dining as entertainment' (think Alinea, etc), but if you are curious this seems like a good start for relatively cheap. The flavors sure are uh interesting.I could see the $2-$2.50/dumpling price tag making sense, but the pricing on the salad seemed offensive - unless those are some really rare peppers being used. Maybe it's the watercress, I have no idea. The salad was really small and by itself, $7. But, it was good.We sort of avoided anything people had complained about and the food we had was great. The drinks are bitter, but this goes well with all the dumplings, which are not bitter. The menu changes often, at time of writing we had the coffee and the hibiscus black tea. The coffee's actually really good for being black, I'd recommend it, it's got just enough flavor tones to be palatable and not overly bitter. The tea, not as much. The beginning of the flavor is good - slightly sweet hibiscus and then slightly bitter, but the end of it has too much bitter bite. It didn't seem possible to cut this by adding some milk or cane syrup.The food we got was:- Lamb dumplings - these were nice- Mango rice dumplings - I think the rice filling could use some flavor that comes out near the end. The toppings were nice, but fade out and by the end it tastes like (better than average) rice pudding/sticky rice- Banana dumplings - really good, not overly sweet, but the sesame paste can overpower everything.- Pastrami dumplings -nice balance all around! the pickled tomatoes and spicy sauce thing on the bottom work well- hush puppies - these went really well with the coconut sour cream! \u00a0felt expensive for $7 by itself since you just get 3- salad -mentioned above - good flavor, great salad, just really expensiveI'd be interested if there would be a way to compromise Sheerin's morals and great flavors with a cheaper menu. Especially for people who need more than a small meal.I imagine that something that would help this restaurant could be building more trust with the local community. I think that pricing transparency would be a huge one, because when we see something that looks like $2 of food that is priced at $7, the knee-jerk reaction is that we're being ripped off.", "I really would have loved to like this place but unfortunately I really didn't... I am in with the concept, I am in for the price because I understand that you are trying to offer some good quality food but honestly the dumplings are just not good enough, at least for me (who I am not a dumplings expert btw). I tried three types: - pecking duck: ok fillings, but the dough was completely off...- short ribs: quite good filling and sauce but again the dough was chewy;- lobster: terrible! really terrible! the lobster was clearly overcooked and chewy, we didn't leave it there because we were hungry...Overall, I found that the main problem is the dough. The fillings are ok, the sauce too. Presentation is actually nice but please improve the dough and I am sure you can bring this place to do much better than how it is doing now.", "PACKED is the ideal blend of delectable flavors and principled dining. Before I mention the impressive and fun dishes, I'll get what I think is many people's biggest concern out of the way, the tab. The proprietors of PACKED are on a mission to bring us sophisticated, delicious, additive-free, responsibly raised, clean food in a fast-casual atmosphere. As the last line of their \"Who we are ...\" poster in the back of the restaurant plainly admits (see picture): \"Being mindful in these respects is not cheap. And it's rare. But we believe in being the change we want to see.\"Why does someone buy Patagonia? Because they make high-quality gear while being an environmentally mindful company. People like what they stand for. Is anyone's entire wardrobe Patagonia? No. I have a few items that I love to wear and feel good about wearing. PACKED is the dining equivalent.Now on to Sheerin's February offerings. Here are my faves; well, here's what I ate/shared. They were all great.The Lamb, the Pastrami, and the Posole were my favorites; followed by the short rib and pork belly bao sandwich. Favorite sides were the mac and cheese, and citrus with roasted coconut salad. Each plate was beautifully garnished and had its own sauce that paired wonderfully with the dumplings. I consider myself a tough critic, and I kept shaking my head at how delicious each dish was. Oh, ya! And I threw all my plates, napkins, cups, and flatware into one trash can, marked 'compostables.' The plates at PACKED will regrow themselves! Sublime. If I had a gripe, it'd be that the soup dumplings' wrappers started to come apart a bit when I lifted them up. Nonetheless, they were rippin' hot and packed with flavor. Bite sized Posole dumplings? Are you kidding me?! Yum!I put PACKED's fare on the same level as many of the high-end restaurants that I've tried in Chicago. No more needing a reservation (or a babysitter) to eat food from one of the nation's top chefs. Sheerin's flavors are no joke. I will be sure to hit PACKED at least once per month to try the new menu. It's worth it, for my palette and my principles. If this sounds like your jam, let PACKED win you over.", "Anyone dinging Packed for long lines on opening weekend is a jerk. Yes, it sucks to wait in line but everything I ate was not only worth the wait in line, but also worth the wait for the restaurant to open many months after it was expected to.As much as I would have liked to try everything on the menu, I was with only one other person and the dumplings had to be ordered in pairs so we sampled the squash, short rib, and pastrami savory dumplings, the mac & cheese side, and the banana and pear sweet dumplings. Soup dumplings weren't yet being served.Everything we ate was delicious. These dumplings are truly gourmet. The fried sage with the squash dumplings was a perfect accompaniment, the whipped horseradish cream with the short rib made all the difference when eating that dumpling. But the true surprise was the toasted shiitakes with the mac & cheese. I would have stood in line again just for a plate of those if I could have possibly eaten another bite.PLEASE do yourself a personal favor and order the banana dumplings with your meal. Quite possibly the best dumpling I've ever had in my life. It rivals a fancy dessert you would have in a 5 star restaurant. Both tables sitting next to us were jealous they didn't order dessert. The staff brings the dumplings out separately almost like a coursed dinner, so dessert will show up last and they won't get cold while you eat the rest of your food.I live way up north but I'll be making the drive several times a month to get back in here and try the stuff we couldn't get through on our first visit, the soup dumplings that weren't yet available, and many many more banana dumplings. I hope this location does so well that the owners can expand to another location closer to me because this place is SOLID!", "Some progress, \u00a0but still much more possible. \u00a0The new lobster and shrimp dumpling is quite delicious! Nice creamy Tofu sauce underneath, \u00a0and the filing had good innate flavor. \u00a0Lamb is also new, \u00a0but like the short rib the meat is bland and the only ingredient inside the dumpling. Tsaziki sauce good but doesn't quite save it. \u00a0Banana dumping nice healthy sweetness, \u00a0but the peanut butter underneath is very thick and coats your mouth so it's the predominant flavor. And the price is still high for hyde park, \u00a0$14 for 6 dumplings...", "3.75 stars but sure it can go up.Long lines on the first day (took about an hour from showing up to getting food) but that's to be expected.Best items: meatball and pastrami dumplings. The meatball was especially tasty.Wouldn't get again: chicken satay is actually a sandwich. The chicken was well seasoned but the sandwich as a whole didn't feel particularly inspired. The bread didn't do much and was dry.The udon Mac and cheese was quite good but a bit cold/the heat was inconsistent throughout the dish. But I could easily see that as a favorite. Worth trying and The plating is quite pretty.", "Was there a couple of days ago. Absolute one of the worst lunches we have had!!! It was pricey and the food was awful! I think the best thing was the hush puppies, and that was not even that great. We went with 4 people. All had different things so we can try. They said it was made when ordered which would take about 15 minutes. We got food and poked at it and everyone looked at each other. We expected to bite into and soft yummy goodness. All the dumplings doughs were hard and room temperature. As a matter of fact mine was a touch cold. The so called mac & cheese??? OMG! DISASTER! So 15 minutes of made to order because it's cooked fresh is really defrosting time?? It sure was not fresh. Not worth the wait.Love the concept of going local. Love that they TRY to get creative. Love that they go green on silverware and plates. Love where they trying to take this, but..sorry. NOT HAPPENING!I would never wish any business to close down, but they really have to revisit, redo and \"re-imagine\". If you want a REAL dumpling....go to Chinatown.", "I went in for lunch and I really enjoyed it! The place is spotless and I thought it was well-decorated and attractive. They have huge windows at the front that open all the way on nice days which was awesome. I believe that the gentleman who took my order at the counter was one of the owners. He was very friendly, walked me through the menu, and seemingly knew everything about each menu item (even told me an interesting tidbit about where one of the ingredients in one of the gourmet sodas was from). The food came out quickly and the presentation looked great. I had pastrami dumplings, short-rib dumplings, and the hush puppies. Each had its own sauce and I thought each complimented its paired dumplings wonderfully. My favorite was the short-rib, but I almost feel guilty saying that because the pastrami dumplings and hush puppies were great as well (the pastrami one has a really unique - in a good way - flavor that you just have to try). My gourmet soda was great too. I was also pleased to see that literally everything involved in my eating experience was recyclable. Overall, this place was great! The owner(s) seem (rightly) to be really excited about the concept and passionate about the food. This seems like a great addition to Hyde Park and I look forward to eating here again!", "First, let me say price is NOT the measure of good food. \u00a0If you're looking for good value and good food, those places are plentiful in Chicago and I frequent many of them. \u00a0Yes, this place is prohibitively expensive for a drop-in lunch, and it's close proximity to far more affordable fare inevitably leads to some reviewer bias. \u00a0However, an eatery should rated on its merits alone.Now onto the food. \u00a0I had my first taste this evening, in leftover form. \u00a0Reheated, 5 hours later, these things were amazing! \u00a0I had the lamb dumplings and the lobster dumplings. \u00a0The lobster was moist and slightly sweet, with a lightly flavored sauce just tying it all together. \u00a0The few shell fragments were a bit of a concern, but they were also a reminder that a real crustacean gave it's life to fill this dumpling. \u00a0The lamb was packed with meat, and while the mouthfeel wasn't quite as moist as I would like, I could attribute that to the oven reheating rather than a shortcoming of the dumpling itself.It's not a value choice, and I certainly won't be a \"regular\", but it's definitely worth a visit and adds nicely to the foodscape in Hyde Park.P.S. I have no idea why they didn't put this place on 53rd where similarly priced offerings would deaden the sticker shock dramatically.", "It's a neat idea, and the dumplings are all competently made and relatively well-conceived (other than the supersweet butternut squash dumpling). But most of them were bland and tasted too similar to one another, and even the most flavorful ones were still mediocre. \u00a0I'll wait until soup dumplings are on the menu before coming back -- I wouldn't rush to come here.", "This place his horrible! Absolutely horrible!!! We spent almost 70 on 3 people, and we left to go to a different restaurant. The dumplings are all very doughy, lack flavor, and inconsistent. Some came out hot, some was lukewarm. The chips, made of baked left over dough used to make the dumplings, were disgusting! They were hard and flavorless. In fact they were so hard they hurt my mouth. I could not imagine why anyone would think to serve that to customers let alone charging $7 for it. Here's a hint: fry them instead. After leaving this place my mouth felt like I just ate a giant dough ball and it was not comfortable. Mac and cheese, which was about 7 pieces of udon noodles barely coated with some sauce, was also a rip off. Their drinks, which sounded very interesting, were also gross! We had a tea and it was very bitter (not tannic, bitter) I had to ask for a different one. Staff moved at a glacial pace. No thank you!", "If you're looking for a traditional dumpling spot- this is not the place for you. \u00a0But if you're looking for a flavorful, fast, and inexpensive treat Then this is perfect. \u00a0 The Peking duck , short rib and lamb dumplings are my favorite. The lobster was a little grainy but the sauces are to die for and although the dumplings seem small they are very filling (about 3-4 will make you full). Two dumplings Is 4-5 dollars so you can't beat it.", "The dumplings are good. The dumplings are not worth $2.50 each. I admire their commitment to locally-farmed ingredients, recycled/recyclable utensils, etc., but how \"sustainable\" is a dining experience that's too expensive to be a go-to option for the vast majority of people? That may not be quite fair--one restaurant shouldn't be expected to change the world. But the whole concept of \"pay more because we pay greater attention to every step of our process\" falls apart when the RESULT of the process isn't amazing, which these dumplings aren't. I find this is a common problem with the artisanal food movement.", "After arriving late to the show on the grand opening Saturday (note: 6:30pm is not the ideal time to try a new spot on opening night), my husband and I dropped in for an early lunch the next morning. The owner recognized us from the night before after a brief conversation we had with him about promising to return at a less busy time. We were able to chat with him a little more and we learned not only is everything local & sustainable, from the food, to the plates to the plastic cups, but they also pay their workers a living wage. As a fellow local small business owner, who also tries to pay workers substantially more than our competitors, this got me right in the heart. And the food! We tried every dumpling and while I enjoyed them all, the real standouts were the pastrami (#1), Peking duck and the braised short rib. I can't wait to frequent this establishment on a regular basis and give my money to a place that obviously cares about both their customers AND employees.", "I LOVE this place. I'd go back daily for the pastrami dumpling. SO good. My favorite of the menu!Love all the fresh drinks too! Great place to go if you are in need of a quick snack or want a very tasty meal! *all the comments about the price- the price didn't bother me when I learn about the quality of the ingredients. Ever wonder why McDonald's is so cheap? They aren't using fresh produce, let alone hormone and antibiotic free meats. Seriously, think about it.", "Really cool, really different. We had the Duck, Short Rib, Lobster and the Mac and cheese. All were good. The sauces are essential. The Mac and cheese was an unexpected treat. We will definitely return.", "1.5I *so* wanted to love this place, even at the price point. I was even willing to let go of the fact the posted prices aren't the \"real\" ones for most items--see the ultra-tiny font. However, the meal at Packed simply left me hungry and dissatisfied. \u00a0The dumplings weren't substantial at all--I had to buy a second lunch after buying their lunch special. \u00a0Moreover, they suffered from execution issues--the dumpling fillings were dry; the wrappers too thick and doughy (like a confused grainy and gummy baozi); the flavors weak or simply off (especially the squash--cloyingly sweet). \u00a0Overall a negative experience--you can make more enjoyable, juicy dumplings off online recipes. \u00a0Fusion food sometimes works, but this was more like confusion food at questionable prices. \u00a0Will regretfully have to give it a pass."], "rest_types": ["Diners,", "Coffee & Tea"], "price_range": "$11-30", "score": 2.977777777777778, "name": "PACKED dumplings reimagined"}, "uvW2R5qHoDbafoPk9-fhMA": {"long": -87.6031163, "lat": 41.8096845, "price_index": "$", "hours": {"Mon": {"open": "11:00 am", "close": "10:00 pm"}, "Wed": {"open": "11:00 am", "close": "10:00 pm"}, "Tue": {"open": "11:00 am", "close": "10:00 pm"}, "Thu": {"open": "11:00 am", "close": "10:00 pm"}, "Fri": {"open": "11:00 am", "close": "11:00 pm"}, "Sat": {"open": "11:00 am", "close": "11:00 pm"}, "Sun": {"open": "Closed", "close": "Closed"}}, "comments": ["Their sweet and sour chicken is absolutely delicious.

Best crab ragoon!!!!! It's not fried hard with a teaspoon of filling. It's made right. For those who say it's too much filling, hey I'd rather have too much and get what I paid for. The beef was tender and not chewy in the fried rice. The fried rice was not greasy and I like that they can make any dish spicy. My egg roll, again made right, not greasy and enough filling where you can actually taste the veggies. I love their shrimp fried rice. They are well mannered, as this is one of the only asian establishments in this neighborhood that has employees who don't have attitudes, yell at you when you make a substitute request or roll their eyes when you ask for extra utensils or napkins.

Good work, De Rice!", "I honestly can't say enough good things about this place. I love the food, they always deliver on time, and their driver is one of the friendliest guys. Their crab Rangoon is a bit sweet (which I love) and there is a large amount of stuffing. Their orange chicken is real and amazing, and so is their Szechuan chicken. I think a lot of their dishes might be a bit sweeter and Americanized, but I love them. The only thing I wasn't too keen on was the Hunan beef, but I only got it once so I might need to try it again. I order from De Rice like once a week. It's addicting.", "first of all ,the food was AMAZING - the beef was succulent, noodles Tasty- it was all good!also the service was excellent- nothing was found wanting !!! would always order here when we come to Chicago!", "Mediocre and disappointing. The sauces were glue-like and generic. The hot and sour soup was inedible. Service was lackluster - we were the only customers and still had a hard time getting water. On the plus side, portion sizes of lunch specials were large.", "Food is mediocre. Nothing to get too excited about. I ordered the orange chicken and it had a distinct fryer oil aftertaste- it makes me think that they leave the oil in their deep fryer longer than they should. Their boba drinks are delicious.", "Absolutely love the food here, and to think I couldn't fine good Chinese food in Hyde Park.I've always ordered food never ate at the place itself but the service is so fast and efficient. They are always kind enough to bring change, and of course the delivery person is so well mannered, and nice, that it makes me feel like this restaurant definitely goes out of it's way for their customer service satisfaction. I ordered the following items: crab ragoon, spicy salmon maki, vegetable fried rice, crispy egg noodles with chicken and veggies, general two chicken, and beef in black bean sauce. All in small sizes, and this portions were huge!! Also they provide such lovely containers for the food, which are reusable. Crab ragoon was good and extremely well filled, however a little too much cream cheese and less of the crab. But crispy! Spicy salmon maki was a bit disappointing, didn't seem fresh and it didn't look to appetizing. However, it tasted fine but not spicy at all. Vegetable fried rice was excellent. Well cooked and not too much soy sauce like some places but the perfect amount. Something I would order again. Crispy egg noodles with chicken and veggies was great as well. Tasted really good and included lots of veggies and chicken. The general tai chicken was delicious! My only complaint is that I wish it was a bit crispier that's all. But I would definitely recommend this. And my absolute favourite and highly recommended dish is the beef in black bean sauce. This is just excellent; great flavours and great tasting. Beef slices are cooked well, the veggies are good, and the black bean sauce is just exquisite. I recommend people try this place! Especially if you're living in Hyde Park, since we are very limited to good food especially in the Chinese cuisine.", "Should have written this A long time ago.

Their Hawaiian fried rice and crab rangoon kept me and my baby alive! now my son is 3.. and I still come back. Love it!

The driver was very nice, and on time exactly. Had a nice short conversation while filling out the receipt and warranted a nice tip. I ordered the Potstickers, Crab Rangoon, and Chicken fried rice. Crab Rangoon was cooked nicely, and a very good helping of filling to boot. Only thing is these were slightly on the sweeter side so I couldn't really eat them all myself. Potstickers were good as well, not too oily but could use a bit more meat inside them. Rice was great! Minimal oil used and flavor was good. Included some good veggies that helped add to the flavor. Will definitely order again!!", "De Rice is the best (cheap) Chinese food outside of Chinatown in Chicago. I've been to the physical store on 47th, although with delivery only $3.00, I've more often bought massive quantities of food to sustain me over the week. Every time I order from them, I get the Jumbo Chicken Fried Rice, which is a steal--that alone is two meals'' worth of food (the Pineapple Chicken fried rice uses the pineapple, as opposed to soy sauce, to provide flavor, which isn't very effective). The scallion pancake is best in my opinion without meat, and I've begun calling the nameless sauce it's served with Crack. I've had some misses here, the Singapore noodles among them (even though my boyfriend loved it, so your mileage may vary), but I've always been incredibly satisfied with my meal. Other recommendations: Broccoli in Garlic Sauce, Eggplant in Szechuan Sauce, Crab Rangoon (if you don't have to move in the next 12 hours), and Peking Duck. The black mushrooms with baby cabbage was one of my least favorite dishes, but it was probably just because I wasn't familiar with the taste of that particular (gamey) mushroom.", "WARNING: this review is sushi biased!!!!I mean...

I ordered crab rangoons, sweet and sour chicken, hot and sour soup with fried noodles, an egg roll, and shrimp fried rice. The crab rangoons were not as crispy (could've been due to the delivery, though), and they were way too full of a creamy substance. I intentionally say creamy substance because it was unlike any cream cheese I've ever seen (very slimy and barely any crab). The sweet and sour chicken was very dry and looked/tasted like it was old. The soup was pretty good, some of the fried noodles were stale, though. The egg roll was perfectly fried, but the inside was filled with some unidentifiable substance...definitely wasn't chicken and/or vegetables (although, I did detect some cabbage). The shrimp fried rice was probably the best thing I ordered, I actually finished all of it and they gave me a pretty large amount even though it was part of the lunch special. I like that they give shrimp fried rice with the lunch special instead of white rice or plain fried rice. I wouldn't recommend this place and I'm not much of a picky eater when it comes to Chinese food.", "Best Chinese food in hyde park by far, and they deliver!! Loved my Mongolian beef!

So as it's very clear the employee is steeling right in front of me for a second time. The cashier says $11.73. No hello, nothing. I said can I get a drink? She looks away. Then back $11.73?! I politely said may I please order a drink w my meal. She handed me a cup and said the new total. I paid in disgust. Then she said Thank You. Then I gave a half smile. She said again loud and stern with attitude THANK YOU!! I just walked away. Hopefully a manager reads this.", "I love Chipotle and I'm glad there is one within walking distance from me, and it always tastes good. I just hate how crowded it is and how long the lines are, also they can be pretty slow but not too bad. I mean I guess the long lines aren't something you can really control though. But it's just like your typical Chipotle if you ask me", "Had 20 minutes before catching the Metra, and I didn't even make it up to the front counter. \u00a04 employees were up at the counter working. \u00a0I simply can't fathom how it was going so slow. \u00a0The only reason this location is still in business is because there are no other locations anywhere nearby...", "Horrible Chipotle location. The main problem with this location is the service. Both the tortilla and the inside of my burrito were repulsively cold. The service is very slow except for the girl who warms the tortilla and puts the rice, beans, and meat into the burrito. The first server gets as many bowls, burritos, etc. out as quick as possible, but since the rest of the service is so slow, a long queue of bowls, burritos, etc. line up for minutes as everything turns cold. It's disgusting. I can tolerate bad service at Chipotle but not to the point where it affects the food. Go to another location or dine at Five Guys down the street.", "I do not understand how there is a line of at least ten people no matter what time of day it is. The location they crammed this Chipotle into is just way too small. They are ALWAYS backed up. They are as bad as the Walgreens on 55th street as far as eternally long lines go... I have only braved the extensive wait one time and the food was absolutely ok. Just ok. You wait in line for ten minutes and get 7 seconds being rushed through your order by the employees and thus end up with a sloppy mess. I think they just simply need more space. Whatever is happening here, it is not working out for the customers OR the employees.", "The one star is being generous. They have piss poor listening skills. ai said no sales on my burrito bowl. Then you put a heaping portion on it. \u00a0then I get irritated when I don't want to pay for that fire pit bowl. They also move very slowly.", "It's a Chipotle! Same as most other Chipotles I've been too. It can get busy and service can sometimes be a bit rushed. But I've also had a few experiences where the staff made up for other inconveniences very professionally. Lines can be long but usually you get what you're thinking you'll get -- a nice, hefty burrito.", "Long ass lines all the time even when it is not supposed to be busy . Calling an order ? Yeah bad idea because you will also have to wait at least 10 minutes for them to realize you are waiting for your order than find your order and HOPEFULLY nothing is wrong with it ! Bad management ! Crappy staff .", "Something very unusual happens to a lot of businesses when they make it to Hyde Park. See the corresponding Walgreen's and Treasure Island locations for further examples. That is, previously successful business models (like the \"fast casual\" restaurant environment of Chipotle) seem to break down and fail. I suspect these failures have been caused by three primary reasons. I'll start with the reason that is most commonly cited in the other reviews here. The service at this Chipotle (and at Treasure Island and Walgreens) is absurdly bad. I never knew that putting wrapping up a burrito or running a cash register was more difficult than heart surgery until I came here. Not only do the employees at this Chipotle make it seem like their jobs are extraordinarily challenging, they also manage to do so while being incredibly rude to their customers. You can go in here and wait in line for 20+ minutes, never even making it to the counter, while you watch 2-3 employees hopelessly construct burritos while 4 or 5 stand in the back doing nothing, and the cashier talks to their coworkers who are either off the clock or just doing nothing. Second is the breakdown of the aforementioned \"fast casual\" restaurant environment that has been so successful at other Chipotles. Most Hyde Park-ers clearly do not have a handle on what this concept means. While the line is often backed up due to poor service, the sheer number of people who call in orders creates a crazy bottleneck that can end up causing the employees to make 10+ burritos before they even get to someone who is actually physically in line. Corollary to this is the fact that many people treat this Chipotle as a dine-in experience - hardly anyone ever seems to take their orders away; they're all physically eating at the Chipotle. This necessitates the location to set aside one or two employees who are either busing tables or cleaning up. This is Chipotle! Bus your own %&$^ing table! The last reason simply has to do with the customers and their ordering behavior. Lots of people here cite the fast lines they've experienced at downtown Chipotles. Now, most people at downtown Chipotles are just getting one burrito for themselves, then they leave. I can't tell you how many times I come in here, and the customer ordering their burrito is actually taking the orders of their family members and dictating it to the employee. At another location, the employees might actually be able to handle, or at least mollify the effects of someone ordering 6 burritos at a time. But that is simple not the case here. I've been here at least a dozen times in the past two years, and at the start, I thought the employees would improve, the staff would get into their burrito-making groove, and all would be well. Unfortunately, I was sorely mistaken and conditions at this Chipotle have only worsened. After going in last night around 7:00 and seeing a stationary 30+ person line, I decided to call it a day on the Hyde Park Chipotle.", "I love chipotle but this one on specific was organized the last time i came. I ordered online ahead of time and once I got there my order wasn't even started on. The workers rush with your order and sometimes mess it up. I only continue to go because I love the food and it's the only one in hyde parks", "The taste of the food is the same compared to other Chicagoland Chipotle's I have been to. However this is the slowest Chipotle most definitely in Chicagoland. If you have somewhere to be or if you know your bus or train will be arriving soon you better not go in this location. There is a downfall in flow from when the employee asks, what are you having? and \u00a0you say what toppings you want on your food. I've never seen this bad of flow even in other fast food restaurants. The crowd does not bother me because Chipotle always has a crowd, but the ability of this location to keep the crowd moving has failed and management needs to reevaluate it. Not to mention there are always employees in the back room area playing around. It's obvious they can be seen and they are aware but the behavior continues. So not only are you waiting FOREVER to get your food, but you see employees goofing off when in your mind you're thinking.... You should tell them to jump on the food line and help. I'm disappointed in this location.", "I love Chipotle, but this is the SLOWEST. CHIPOTLE. EVER. I have stood in line for a whole hour here before, and other times just shy of it. Ugh. They really need to do something about it! Add more workers, speed their people up or SOMETHING! Also, their ingredients are a hit or miss. Sometimes it's delicious, other times it's burnt or overcooked or just plain bad. Hyde Park Chipotle need some TLC. Come on now.", "Chicago ghetto service. Burrito was fine. When I got to the register the person was on the phone. Inattentive. Had to tell her order was for here 3 times. Then I ordered a large drink and she snarled that there were no large drinks. All other Chipotle restaurants have large drinks. \u00a0So this is what earns the Chicago ghetto \u00a0comment. I won't be back.", "Not a great Chipotle location. The staff is inattentive and really half-assed my burrito. Compared to the chipotle I go to in the loop for lunch, they have terrible service. I doubt any of the employees would even last a single lunch shift there.Meh.", "I have no problem with this chipotle, except that it's always busy.

The buffet had no theme, just random food that appeared was leftover from the week. I decided to try the jambalaya, crab balls and stuffed claims. What a waste of food.

So, after mentioning Beggars (which she didn't want), I suggested Medici. Hadn't had it in several years, but when I did, it was so memorable and amazing that I thought it would be a good choice. Called and placed the order. Simple medium sausage pizza. She said it would be about an hour, hour and a half. Surely about an hour later, a cold, soggy pizza with crumbled up sausage on it came through the door. It was absolutely disgusting. And did I mention cold? So, I called the store and explained what I just explained to the lady who answered. She placed me on hold to get the manager. A female voice answered and said \"hello?\" So I explained the story again. She placed me on hold. At this time, I'm very slightly agitated because I've waited an hour for this pizza and I'm hungry. So, asked y coworker \"Why do I have to keep being placed on hold for a manager?\" to which the manager (who was now on the phone) answered, \"Because they had to come find me, that's why.\" Um... Okay. So, I explained and she responded by telling me that I order sausage pizzas all the time and I've never complained and how they haven't done anything out of the ordinary to this one so why am I complaining now. I'm like, \"Um, no... I haven't had pizza from here in years...\" To which she responds (as if I'm lying), that the system keeps a log of my orders and that I clearly order from there all the time. So, after explaining that I was calling from work and that I work in a very large building and OTHER coworkers and others in the building might order from there frequently, I don't and that their orders have nothing to do with me. When I told her the pizza was cold, she told me that the pizza comes out of the oven and into an insulated bag right away for delivery, so there's no way the pizza is cold. As if I don't know what the hell cold pizza tastes like. She gave a wack ass dry response about how she's going to go make sure they're making the pizzas right or some bullshit. And got off the phone. With her nasty ass attitude. I'll probably eat there again, but I'll have to dine in. Oh!

My favorite is the chocolate croissant. It is sooooo good. I've also had their Mexican chocolate milkshake, which is amazing.

I knew this place was known for its pizza but we wanted to keep our late lunch light and so opted for the salmon burger and the garbage burger. The take out containers were really cute and seemed also ideal for going to the beach or anywhere else on the run. Let's start with the garbage burger. It looked great! It was somewhat warm and medium as I asked. I was not impressed with the potato bun and recommend that you ask for any other bun besides that one. It was dry and was crumbling as I was eating which was a little annoying. There were a generous amount of toppings for a ten dollar burger. I wasn't a fan of the barbecue sauce which was much sweeter than what I normally like. The slaw was really good though and the portion was just right. The salmon burger was also underwhelming for my partner. It was a generous size but also dry. The sauce on it didn't help very much and it still tastes pretty bland. The fries were good on the side. If we were to come back we'd try the pizza and stay away from the burgers. We peeked at sandwiches and those portions were large too.

There was a table of 3 seated next to us, and the lady was pretty rude and kind of put the staff through the ringer-they were polite and accommodating to her demands.

When I'm scheduled to have lunch with friends and I hear the words \"let's go to Medici!\" my heart sinks a little. The restaurant is a classic UChicago student joint, a real institution, writing on the walls, etc. etc. But once the cute college vibe wears off, it's a place that serves overpriced food with mixed quality. For example: the black bean burger, one of the only vegetarian entrees, costs $13. It's a frozen burger with a scalloped edge that Costco sells by the dozen. Here it is: morningstarfarms.com/pro\u2026For $13, couldn't they make their own homemade veggie burgers? Either make it from scratch or lower the price! Otherwise it's just a rip-off. A similar situation with the guacamole appetizer: $7 for a bite-sized nugget of guacamole, not even remotely enough for a table to share.But here's where my opinion really plummets: I've now TWICE been served spoiled potato salad. As in FIZZY. I sent it back and I was given fresh potato salad, which was fine -- but this happened twice to me, and once to a friend, which suggests it's a fairly regular thing. No restaurant should serve spoiled food.In summary:Bakery: 4 stars Restaurant: 2 stars and a frowny face in sharpie on the table", "Come here to hang out with a big group or for the fresh bread or pastries at the bakery, but food on the restaurant side is disappointing. It's standard, slightly pricey diner fare lacking any sort of wow factor. Garbage pizza is covered with plenty of cheese and plenty of bacon, pepperoni, and sausage. Nothing tasted very fresh, and it's extremely greasy and salty. Great drunk food, yes - great food, no.Spinach goat cheese pizza was similarly greasy and doused in pesto, causing the crust to be very soggy, especially in the middle. Tuna steak sandwich ($13) was mediocre at best, the yellowfin didn't taste fresh and the ginger-sesame mayo just tasted like regular old mayo. Burgers are good but standard, as are the shoestring fries. Smoked salmon eggs benedict ($13) during brunch was subpar, the hollandaise broke and was very watery. The potatoes were extremely greasy - again, not a fan.Cappuccino and mexicana shake are good. The pumpkin cheesecake shake (only served during autumn months) is a standout.", "I have been here three times and have always been happy with the ambience, the service, and the food. The walls are decorated with eclectic art from cubism, to tree slices, to an Indian goddess statue. There is pretty rooftop dining during warm months.

I've never had anything I didn't like, and I've also never had anything I really really loved (even the Mexicana shake.... it's fine. I'm ambivalent).That said, I think this place fills an important neighborhood niche, especially with fancier places like A10 and the Promontory coming in. It's a really nice middle range, and it's a \"fancy\" pizza place.

He was extremely rude to us the entire time. He would lurk by our table and at one point, stood over us for at least 30 seconds of silence before asking if we needed our drinks refilled. It seemed like asking him for anything was an issue, after asking to have my husbands sprite refilled and he huffed as he walked away. I can't tell you how uncomfortable I felt leaving, and then to turn around and see him outside, watching us drive away as we left the restaurant made it worse. The four of us agreed that we all felt very creeped out.The kicker is that I called the manager-on-duty almost immediately, explained how uncomfortable we were, and was assured we would have the restaurant manager call me back.

She said she could give me a 15% credit FOR THE NEXT TIME, which was ridiculous since you can find online coupons for more.The delivery person was someone else, again, not the person I'm used to seeing.

The new location is set back a bit and hard to see from the street, but there are some big flags that announced the grand opening - hopefully those will stay up for a while.I ordered a pizza for carryout from there yesterday, and it was great. The food is obviously just your typical Papa John's, but I really think it's the best chain delivery style pizza around. I find it to be much less greasy than Domino's, and it doesn't give you that weird feeling in your mouth (and/or arteries) that you just consumed an entire mine's worth of salt. The folks working at the counter when I went to pick it up were friendly, helpful, and best of all, quick and efficient. No problems that you might typically encounter at a relatively new take-out place.I haven't yet ordered delivery from this location yet, but I've seen Papa John's delivery cars driving through the neighborhood so I would guess they've been pretty active already. \u00a0I'm sure once school starts again in the fall they will be plenty busy.

I HATE their original sausage. It tastes like Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage.

Secondly, definitely tastes like there were better, or shall I say, fresher ingredients. The pizza was not greasy, was not overcooked or undercooked. Whatever we ordered was delivered to us. No complaints.The second time that we ordered from Papa Johns, the pizza and the cheesesticks were delicious. Again, same goodness. This time, we got a call after 30 minutes of ordering from their location to let us know that they were running behind because of lack of drivers available. They called! Yes, that was courteous and honestly, I appreciated that very much.

We placed the order around 11:40 on a Thursday and the food came around 12:50, which was a long time, but within the time period they predicted. The food was really f*cking delicious. There was actually a lot more food included that you usually get with lunch specials. The fried rice was really tasty and there was a lot of it. The eggrolls were also amazing. My Kung Pao chicken was packed with celery (a little too much in my opinion) but there were also tons of peanuts and baby corns. The flavor was great - enough chili peppers that my mouth and lips were tingly but not overwhelmingly hot. The chicken was also good and I didn't have the problems with gristle or toughness that other reviewers did. My friend's sesame chicken came covered in sesame seeds but the flavor was really good and there was a lot of chicken - also all well cooked. We were so full that we didn't try the Chow Mein.

So, of course we wanted to have a little bit of everything on the menu to decide if this was a keeper or not. While they're known for their hot links, I think a true PitMaster's test is proven within their ribs and rib tips. We settled on the jumbo tips ($14.50), the wing special (8/$6.50) and later discovered it was a better deal to go with the jumbo tip and link special ($15.00). We went with the mixed sauce, which was supposed to be a little hot, yet, still sweet. Boy were we wrong, that stuff was SOOO hot, we could barely eat our food! The rib tips were nice and tender and the wings where your average wings. The hot links were pretty good, but again, they were hot as heck! The only issue we encountered was with our decision to change to the combo jumbo tip & link. It was $15 vs. the $14.50, we paid for just the Jumbo Tip. So, we should have paid the difference ($. 50) plus taxes (10.25%). However, they charged us another $1.09, which was a $. 60 tax on a \u00a0$.50 item. Who does that?

I drove past another spot and they didn't take credit cards either so I jumped on yelp and Uncle J's came up. \u00a0I called to see if they took credit cards and she said yes but they don't let you call in your order.

So I placed my order and since the place is about the size of my hallway I went to my car to wait. About 15 mins later my order was ready. I dug into it when I got home and it was worth my drive over to the south side. The BBQ sauce was a little spicy but the ribs were deelish!!! Very meaty! The chicken wings were good...basic wings you would get at a rib joint. Nothing spectacular but good; I would do the combo again.

When I come back, it's hot and ready.  I've only had the tips, chicken wings and pork links but they are soooo good.

In my last review I stated I went to Uncle J's to sample the bbq before placing a huge order for a family gathering, When I originally talked to the mgr/owner he stated I could pay for the order the day before and pick it up the day I needed it. Unfortunately I was unable to go by the day before so I called the day of \u00a0around 1pm. and the mgr would not come to the phone to talk to me so he allowed this teenage girl to take my order. She gave me the total and I informed her I will come pick up at 530pm. When I arrived at 535pm my order was not ready and I had 10 hungry family member at my home waiting for food. I was furious! Not only was I angry at the point that I was told my order would be ready but I was also furious that the manger refused to come and address his customer. When he finally waddled his fat butt out of the back he began to argue with me and tell me I need to pay ahead of time and it would be an hour before he could have my order ready. Not only was he rude but when I looked in the smoker where was NO FOOD! I assume he was going to have to cook my order. Anyone who has ever bbq'd knows it will take more than an hour to do so. I stormed out and went to UNCLE JOHNS ON 83RD. When I got to 83rd I was met with a smile and with compassion when I told her my story and that I have 10 family members waiting. She simple said \"give me 15 minutes\" in around 30 minutes I walked out with tons of food and I was very happy!

The food was plentiful. I ordered a slab of ribs and small order of hot links. The ribs were good and we had enough meat to eat for two days, the same with the hot links. The links were hot but I could've used more sauce. I would recommend Uncle J's to my friends and neighbors. Oh yeah, their service is quick.

I met an interview subject here on Sunday for an hour-long chat, and was totally unimpressed with the service. When I walked in, I couldn't figure out if I should seat myself or wait for someone to seat me. It was busy so I wound up seating myself while waiting to figure out where my subject was, but there was no acknowledgement of my presence for at least 5 minutes. No biggie - I figured out where my subject was seated and went over to her table anyways after perusing the menu for a few minutes. She had already ordered for herself and her sons, so I flagged down the waitress and ordered a hot apple cider before getting into my interview. She acknowledged my order but then... either totally forgot about it or the baristas just forgot to make my drink. At this point, my interview subject was talking so I didn't feel comfortable interrupting our interview to ask for my drink. Service was slow overall but it seems like my subject was pretty happy with what she had ordered for herself and her sons, so that's why two stars instead of one. The music here was also really loud and didn't really give me a cafe vibe, and it was definitely hard for me to hear my conversation, even though I was just sitting on the opposite side of the table. I'm sure their drinks are great, but it just wasn't an awesome experience for me.", "This cafe' is defintely a new concept and part of investment in a community that needs a commercial boost. I loved the feel of the place--very homey and artsy. Many students were studying there and eating breakfast by 10 a.m. today. The server was very friendly and quick to ask us if we were only getting coffee or also food. My review, however, doesn't include food because we didn't have any. However, I only went in for their popular Green Goddess, a minty drink on my way to a longer driver. I ordered it with almond milk, and it was a mistake because it got very diluted (a 2/5 alone). Anyhow, I would give this place another try due to the buzz about the chilaquiles and to support local businesses.", "I was looking for a good post-race meal that would be marginally healthy, when Yelp suggested this place near Jackson Park. It's actually in or around Washington Park, but it was only about a 10 minute Divvy-ride, so I went for it.The Divvy station is right across the (six-lane) street, which was pretty convenient; it's also pretty convenient to just get off the Green Line at Garfield. Anyways, I really liked the look of the inside, which I'm guessing took inspiration from a Currency Exchange that used to be on the site? I didn't ask, and I blame that on having just run a half-marathon.I ordered the chilaquiles, in part because I had no idea what they were. It's actually a lot of chips sitting in a jalape\u00f1o-tomato sauce, covered in chicken, sour cream, cheese and eggs, which I ordered scrambled. Though I've seriously never been hungover, I suspect this would do quite nicely as a fixer-upper.The flavor was over-the-top good on these. Chips were crispy, salty and flavorful, and the chicken was deliciously marinated in something resembling a distant cousin of jerk sauce. The sour cream went perfectly with fluffy, moist scrambled eggs. And the tomato sauce gave it a good kick to boot.It's a long haul from downtown, but it is worth your time to cash in at the Currency Exchange Caf\u00e9.", "Not totally vegan, but I'll take what was offered to me for breakfast. Service was great and the staff was friendly to me.

Their food is good but slow to come out. The taco's were amazing and the jambalaya is delicious.", "This place looked cute on the inside and had a welcoming environment. However the overall experience fell flat of what I expected based off the reviews posted here. I had the cold brew and my bf had the hot coffee. These were on point and the strength and flavors were great (4 stars), but that's where it ended. I got the veggie tacos and maybe I should I have tried something like the biscuits everyone raves about. Maybe my expectations are too high because I'm from Texas, but I felt the veggie tacos were like what I could get at Taco Bell but twice the price. The tortillas were obviously store bought. Beans were flavorless. They used iceberg lettuce on top with a small pitiful amount of tomatoes. They forgot my avocado that comes with the dish and they brought it out with no issue when I mentioned it was forgotten, but that didn't make it any better. I also got the free street corn yelp offer; all I can say is that I was glad it was free. Had to add salt and it made the dish kind of good, but I've grown up with real street corn and that is not it. I can tell the corn was from a can. At lease roast real corn on the cob and chop it off the cob or don't do it at all if you are planning to use canned.Also, the service was pretty lacking. The girls were nice but not attentive. I put in my coffee order right away then had to make an important call. 10 minutes later when I'm still on the phone, they come back to ask if I ordered anything. Yes, I ordered cold brew. My friend got his salad before I got my coffee. After I got done with my phone call I had to flag them down multiple times to put in an order and it took way too long to get those two sad tacos. A disappointing experience overall. If you come, it's a cool place to hang out, but just get the coffee and not their food.", "I give it an star because the place is really nice inside and the great location. However the service is unacceptable, not too many selections on the menu and the food wasn't exactly explained or specials were not offered. So to my conclusion I will not be back. Very unfortunate because this place could have been my favorite spot. Damn", "I love this coffee spot. The space is great. It's a treat to work from here. I really like the decor.

The space is open and eclectically decorated; very sophisticated but fun. The two staff were incredibly friendly and answered any questions we had. We ordered the Coco Loco, La Ma\u00f1ana, and Chilaquiles. The Coco Loco cold brew with almond milk and coconut syrup was smooth and not overly sweet with great coconut flavor. La Ma\u00f1ana was a nice light breakfast of ripe grapefruit, hard boiled egg and a soft, delicious, homemade biscuit. The chilaquiles were a perfectly proportioned mix of tortillas, chicken, and cheese with a fried egg and mouth-watering chipotle sauce. Prices were great for portion sizes. If we are ever in the area, we'd definitely stop by again! Highly recommended.", "A beautiful environment with a warm energy.

Nice atmosphere for coffee, conversation & food u can also have events here. They have nice smooth music playing in background not too loud. The d\u00e9cor is interesting. Now the food. I ordered the COCO LOCO(cold coffee, coconut syrup & almond milk. The flavors were nice just wish the coffee was a tad stronger w/the ice it became watery. I had the BREAKFAST BOWL(2 eggs however u liked mine was fried w/ lil yoke they did it right in between rice & I had bacon which was diced up. It had decent flavor to it.

The location is absolutely stunning- I could spend an entire day in there. It's easy to get to from the Green Line or MLK Drive bus, has wide open hours, and super helpful sweet staff.The food is the real prize here though- the pancakes are among the best I've ever had, and I've also really enjoyed their tacos and donut holes.

The \"blue plate specials\" are priced right and well-portioned. Highly recommend the greens (in case you missed that opening line).They still have some links to work out though. The Beyond Chicken was a little bland and the Street Corn was over-done, slightly tough, and had some really hard bits that did not sit so well on the teeth.

We figured there was plenty tomato flavoring already so we ordered that and it took about 40 minutes to make. We were happy we had lunch earlier than expected cuz it took awhile and we'd be starving.

It was easily identifiable just by the sign, I thought it was a small park from a distance. I loved the whole feel of the restaurant. It felt like a 70s family diner in an old Italian American neighborhood. When we saw our pizza we just quickly indulged in it right away. The outside crust was so crunchy and loved the cheese. The bread inside was perfectly soft and I loved the peppers. I then had to take a picture and the waiter kindly took out a slice slowly while the gooey cheese stretched into our plate. The customer service was great and I loved the lemonade I ordered. Would recommend this location to anyone coming here. I enjoyed my time here as a cali native and still dream of it.

Once I got there I was told the pizza and wings were not ready yet. So I requested to be seated, I had a party of 4 people...there were plenty of empty tables AVAILABLE in both Sides of the restaurant.

I told him to cancel my order of wings. He made the cashier open his drawer and gave me $7.25 in cash, not sure how he figured out that amount. I left and called the restaurant just to find out how much were the wings, person that answered said $8.95 plus tax so I decided to go back and asked for the difference. There he was again with an attitude and made the same cashier open his drawer and pay me $1.50 more.

I know the south side gets screwed on having nice things (most of the time I understand why) but obviously people who can and want to drop $30 on one pizza and pick it up themselves, deserve a solid presentation.", "We did a delivery order from this location since we wanted to stay in on Sunday night to watch football.1) if you are not from the area at all, it's very difficult to find a location to deliver to you.2) it's a standard at least 1 hour wait for your food.3) kudos to the delivery guy for having plates/silverwareI got the chicken carbonara and had a house salad. It was delicious!!! I love that they used the big tube pasta and there was chucks of chicken and bacon. They definitely did not skimp on the bacon!!!The boyfriend got the Northside sandwich. IT WAS MASSIVE. Legit could be two meals. It was meat baked into their pizza dough and came with parm garlic fries. He loved it!!!pretty impressive for being take out and them having numerous locations throughout IL.", "Delivery took a while but we were expecting it too so we ordered well in advance of our hunger. It seems pricy but the amount of pizza you get is way more than you'd get elsewhere. Don't complain, be an informed consumer. The wait is worth it, for sure. The super veggie was amazing!!", "Giordano makes the best pizza ever! That's not an exaggeration either! Literally, I have never tasted pizza as good as Giordano pizza. Their stuffed pizza is heavy on the dough and crunchy on the crust. On top of that, they layer the pizza with really thick flavorful sauce.In stark contrast, their customer service usually isn't the best. Usually, I ask for light cheese, and sometimes, they follow through. But 75% of the time, they forget. Not only that, but on two separate occasions, they completely forgot about my order, and I had to wait an extra hour to get my pizza.But luckily, customer service varies based on location. Overall, I would give the chain 4 stars (this review is more for the chain than for the Hyde Park location), while the Hyde Park location gets only 3 stars because of customer service. If customer service were to improve, then this would truly be a solid pizza establishment.", "Ordered a small deep-dish pizza with sausage, mushrooms, spinach. \u00a0Pie came to the table very warm, not hot. \u00a0Not a very flavorful pie, my wife and I both agreed. \u00a0The crust was downright bland. \u00a0The impression we left with is a restaurant that was likely good when it started, but lost its way through franchising. \u00a0If this is deep-dish pizza, I'll stick with thin crust, thank you.", "Worst service ever! I'm an HP resident and former frequent customer. Today I ordered a pizza for pick up, the cashier, Alazhe, entered it as a delivery. Between her and the manager, Islam, it took 10 minutes to undo this error but it was corrected. Upon returning approximately 40 minutes later my pizza was nowhere to be found, however when asked, the chef confirmed it was made. Realizing this, I requested a refund. The manager, Islam, with no attempt to correct this error or retain my patronage gave me my refund. So much for my pizza during the football game. I, nor anyone who I can influence, will be patronizing this establishment again. You have lost a neighborhood customer through simple incompetence.", "Came here to try deep dish pizza for the first time! We got the medium sized vegetarian pizza and it tasted great! It takes about an hour to come, and the pizza is so heavy (physically) so you'll get stuffed by just having one slice. The customer service is friendly, and the interiors are nice, a bit crowded.", "The pizza was really good, definitely top 5. We got the sampler for an appetizer. The cheese sticks, ravioli, and cheesy garlic bread were great. I tried the mushrooms and didn't really care for them ( I don't like mushrooms though) They have a couple of weird policies. We couldn't sub one topping for another one on a pizza. You also couldn't get a fresh glass for a refill, they have to take yours back and fill it. If you want a fresh glass they charge you for another drink.", "WOW, i ordered a large Pizza, Salad, and Chocolate Cake with Ice Cream. \u00a0They sent me a HALF SLICE OF CAKE, yes, the bottom 2 layers were missing, and the description says \"a BIG slice\" with ice cream and hot fudge. \u00a0I got a sliver versus big slice, of which TWO layers were missing and NO ICE CREAM. \u00a0For 7 dollars, they've got the last 50 dollars they'll ever see from me. \u00a0The lack of quality control on take out/delivery orders is astounding. \u00a0A half sliver of cake for 7 dollars ha! Something told me to just drive to Aurelio's, this is what laziness gets me, sub par customer service and the bad part is i knew better because this is how they are rude, inconsistent, and inefficient. Now to the pizza, It's burned, i ordered a large. \u00a0So the Outer 8-10 pieces are burned crisp, and the middle two rows are edible, I ate it and it was okay. Not good and not bad, just okay. \u00a0Again, I will never order from them.", "Last night I visited the Hyde park location. And was very displeased with the service. \u00a0The staff @the counter cared less if the orders were Served or picked up.", "Ahhhh.. Winter is nearly here! Today I decided to order a stuffed spinach and mushroom pizza from one of my favorite pizzerias. After waiting nearly 2 hours for delivery, to my dismay the pizza order was entered incorrectly. The pizza was actually stuffed sausage and mushroom. No problem, right? It wouldn't be if I ate meat, which I don't. I returned the pizza to the delivery driver. After calling the restaurant and speaking with the store manager \"Sid\", I was told that they would make me a second pizza (which would take another 2 hours) and he would be more than happy to \"take $5.00 off of my order.\" I think this is a shameful way to show respect for customer loyalty and a drastic inconvenience. I will NOT be ordering from them again. I am disappointed in the lack of customer service the manager displayed today.", "They have good tasty pizza here. I like the fact that they are one of the few places in Chicago that have Chicken Sausage available as a topping. I have been coming to this place for years now.

I figured, why not. I ordered crab rangoon, gyoza, and orange chicken with shrimp fried rice but I substituted chicken for an extra dollar (??). I was not too happy to fork over that extra dollar but I prefer chicken fried rice.Order was supposed to be delivered in an hour and it arrived in about and hour and 10 minutes, which wasn't horrible but was annoying. Food arrived and there was a lot of food. Like a lot of food. Enough for days. The rice was okay but there were way too many mushrooms and it was missing something. The rangoons were mediocre - more breading than anything. There were was very little crab/cream cheese mixture. The gyoza were great. The orange chicken tastes like orange chicken.Overall, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this restaurant. The food is okay and the price was right, but that's about it.", "Sadly, it appears that this restaurant has closed.

Very generous portions to share! Delivery has always been swift and courteous for me.", "Surprisingly, everything was super tasty. I've never had Chinese food this fresh, and on the south side of the city at that. The portion sizes are nice as well. Makes for a day or two of leftovers. I'll definitely be returning.", "They serve some of the best Chinese and Thai food I've ever had! The beef fried rice was awesome and so was the cashew nut chicken.

And all he repeated on the phone was \"COME OUTSIDE\"! Not even a PLEASE! I had to go back up to get my keys and come outside again, then he explains (in Mandarin) that he never delivers into the building in the evenings because it is dangerous. Wow! How brave is every single delivery man from everywhere else! I should rate Papa John's 100 stars, right? And I didn't even ask him to come inside, just to the building door because I had no key with me! Delivery fee was paid for delivery service. Not only the service was incomplete, but I also received no respect at all.

I don't know what her problem was, if she was just being cheap or just plainly didn't want to give me a menu but I didn't appreciate it. And I had one before but lost it so I know they most likely did have some. Anyway, I tried to order some sushi and guess what, they had no Japanese food. I just left, annoyed.

WTF?! So there's only one person responsible for preparing sushi @ this place?! Not cool!

Everything was tasty but (& here's the second peculiar thing) the Mussels order came with chicken on it! I've never had a Mussels dish with bits of chicken amongst it, but it did work in this case & I ate it all! Mainly because I was starving!

The variety of options from the menu was great, but everything was pre-ordered for the group I was with. The service overall was good, but lets dive into the food! I ate a lot. For starters there was the fried calamari and the Tex-Mex Egg Roll which were okay. The Mixed Baby Green Salad was good with vinaigrette was delicious. It normally comes with raspberry vinaigrette but that was a little thick and not preferred. The main courses that I personally tried was the Pasta Shells with Salmon which were season well and had mushrooms, which is personal dislike of mine, but it was still good nevertheless.The Tequila Lime Chicken fettuccine which was my favorite was well seasoned and very tasty. Definitely recommend! Also had a slice of Pesto Lover pizza which was just okay, nothing special and also a slice of the Chicago style pizza (Sausage, cheese, and spinach). This was relatively good, but I also love pizza so there might be a little bias. We ate a lot, the food just coming!! Overall good experience, but there were some negatives. First, I noticed some issues with the cleanliness of the dining plates. To be servicing some high VP's from the organization I work for I was disappointed and had to ask for cleaner plates. Also other minor things in service that was lacking. Again, just an okay experience which may have been improved if the group was smaller.

We got the stuffed deep dish (Chicago style pizza) and it was delectable. Nice and tasty. It was perfectly crispy. A major complaint is that my friend ordered a tossed salad and requested blue cheese dressing. She was told that it would cost $4 extra. So she paid the money and when she got home she had a small condiment cup of blue cheese crumbles...not dressing. She ended up not eating her salad (wasted money).

Despite the mediocre reviews on Yelp, we figured it was a safe bet because it was so close to the hotel our food would not lose its freshness and its difficult to mess up italian food. I ordered the Farmer's Sandwich, and my friend ordered the fried calamari and the creamy garlic chicken alfredo.The calamari looked like they bought it frozen and fried it, and served it with watery marinara sauce. It was probably the worst fried calamari I've ever had.The grilled chicken breast in my sandwich was dry and burnt on some parts and the veggies made the bread completely soggy. The sandwich seemed as if it had been just sitting there for quite a while wrapped in Saran wrap waiting for the rest of the order to be made and walked over to our hotel room. To improve this experience, I would recommend learning to make food orders in a logical order.I most definitely would not recommend ordering takeout from here to anyone.

Either way, I had salmon, tamago and quail egg nigiri - all of which tasted fresh and were delicious. They have many unique rolls, many of which have a Chicago or Hyde Park tie in in the name which is fun. Rolling was pretty messy, loose and cuts were not smooth but despite a not so elegant plating and construction, the flavor was still there.I had a wine flight of 3 reds for $8.50 which is about the same as a glass of wine - so why not try some variety!? 'Twas a fun thing to try some new wines.Service was attentive and very prompt....bordering on stalkerish.

I've been scared of the Southside since I was a kid. My parents instilled a fear on me about the Southside (and many other things) that I couldn't shake off. If you don't count Downtown Chi-town as the south, the only other parts of the Southside I ever witness, being in Chicago for 30+ years is the occasional free White Sox game at US Cellular Field, and Chinatown. Any street that contained numbers ie. 1st, 2nd, etc, was bad news for this timid Chinese guy.But boy, was I wrong! The \"hidden\" gem of Hyde Park is really nice! This place, located not to far from the University of Chicago, offers a wide-variety of food. They have american soups, sandwiches, pizza (!) and....... sushi.I had a couple of their rolls:Chicago Fire -- Tuna, fresh salmon, super white tuna, avocado, jalapeno, cilantroDrunken Tiger -- Crab, avocado, cucumber roll topped with shrimp and mango tobiko sauceand Tamago / Sweet egg omelet makiAll where very delicious, the rolls had 6-8 pieces and I was somewhat full. They had wine flights too. The service was really good and prompt.BATHROOM REVIEW: Located near the back, adjacent to the waiting station, the bathroom is a single-person bathroom, consisting of a urinal and toilet. The urinal was somewhat high-up, definitely not for the average Asian guy's height (5'9\") like me, but I managed. The toilet was pretty clean and they had those push-straight-down paper towel dispensers. There was plenty of hand soap and overall the bathroom was clean indeed. Sit or squat? Sit!!", "The service is always great. I can only comment on the sushi because that's the only thing I have eaten (but I heard people rave about the pizza). The sushi is....okay. I tried a roll called \"Chicago Fire\" and it contained raw tuna that tasted really fishy. And had my friend not informed me that it also contained jalape\u00f1o I would not have known. I tried the Drunken Tiger and it was good but personally I don't like sweet sauce (comes with a mango sauce) so shame on me for stealing a roll off my friend's plate lol.

Food came out quick, but I did come at an off hour.", "Summary: cute restaurant with good food, but slow service and comparatively high prices.I got three pieces of salmon sahimi and a steak sandwich when I came here. Sashimi was super THIN cut... was not impressed. The steak sandwich came with a choice of side (veggie chips, fruit, or berries). I got the berries and it was literally 3 raspberries, 1 chopped up strawberry, and 6 blueberries in a bowl. The steak sandwich was very flavorful, and quite light. My friend got the veggie chips in a bowl, and it was literally less than a handful. Pretty meager portions if you ask me...The sushi rolls are not my type. They're kind of expensive for what you get... you could get much better rolls for the same price at other Chicago restaurants.Service is very slow, even when the restaurant doesn't look that busy. It took ages before someone even came to take our order, and then again when we were waiting for our food. I saw much sashimi just sitting on the counter for 15 minutes, since it seemed they wanted to bring it over with the rest of our food.", "Stopped by one evening after driving around Hyde park and stumbled onto this place, I had been before for lunch and it was a pretty good experience so I figured I would give it a shot for sushi...not the greatest outcome the rolls were poorly made they were falling apart before we touched them and the fish didn't exactly taste fresh and the flavors were uninspiring...we wanted to like this place as the service was really good but the food just wasn't very good, can't say that I will be back with so many other options close by", "Slightly overpriced, but the highest quality sushi in Hyde Park. The $16 dinner combos are a good deal, and enough food for 2. The other menu items like sandwiches and pizza are overpriced and mediocre.", "I'm never, ever disappointed. My go to for sushi and drinks. I adore the martinis; I've had almost all of them. The plum is my favorite! Anything eel is gold because of my shellfish allergy. I love the atmosphere, music, and the staff are really laid back.", "Overall good place. Now their menu is very eclectic. It is more than you would ever expect. At times, I shun away from places that try to be everything to everyone. However, this place just does all their food, good enough. Great service and located right in the middle of Hyde Park. I usually get a roll or two. The simple classics are my favorites here such as the Philli or the Veggie maki. However, at times I'll go for the 52nd or the Chicago Fire. I also normally go for the pizza when I'm there. It is very light and thing and airy. It's perfect. I would suggest you try it out for yourself. It's worth it. Especially for a quick lunch date.", "The Sit Down's menu is expansive, and features everything from sushi to pizza. I don't think it would be fitting to call this Italian/Japanese fusion, more like half Italian, half Japanese with a healthy dose of American influence thrown in!Big Bang maki had salmon and three types of tuna, all of which tasted fresh. The maguro added a nice fattiness to the roll.The Super Crunchy was filled with fat tempuraa shrimp paired with avocado and a nice drizzle of jalapeno sauce. It's not exactly cheap for the amount of sushi you get and the rolls aren't anything too creative, but still a solid choice for Hyde Park.", "I've been here once before years ago and I've been dying to get back ever since. I finally went back today and was very happy I did. I ordered the Blue Apple salad. I requested some ingredient changes and was easily accommodated. The salad was delish. I may have to go back again tomorrow since I will be in the area. In the past, I ordered the Chicken Pesto sandwich with Veggie Chips. The veggie chips are super flavorful. I think I also had the sushi and it was great. All of the food is affordable especially given the quality. I highly recommend this restaurant. Two thumbs way up!", "I stopped at Sit Down Cafe the other day when I was in the area, and I think I would definitely stop back if I was nearby again. For gluten free in Hyde Park, they are A-OK in my book!First of all, the menu is AMAZING for gluten free options. They have everything from gluten free pizza to bruschetta and sandwiches. I opted for the chicken pesto sandwich, and it was great! The bread was toasted, which masked the fact that it was gluten free, and the pesto, artichoke, tomato, and chicken combined to make a warm sandwich that is BY FAR the best I've had in all my gluten free days. My one complaint was that the sandwich was a little oily - as I tried to eat it, oil was dripping all over me! Afterwards, I felt the oil kind of sit in my stomach in that \"I'm so stuffed and feel sort of ill\" way, but I don't think that was enough of a negative to not come back for another. Also, each sandwich came with a side of berries, fruit, or chips. The berries were a nice, healthy complement to a tasty sandwich, and they were so fresh!For gluten free in Hyde Park (and anyone visiting the University of Chicago Celiac Center!) I would definitely recommend stopping here to check out the gluten free sandwiches.", "This is a great spot in hyde park. The small restaurant has some good items on the menu. I have tried several of the ebi tempura rolls. The place is clean and it's typically moderate on the noise. They lost a star with the staff dress. In the summer the wait staff wear some raunchy clothes. I see camisoles as shirt, booty shorts, skin tights, etc. It's inappropriate and disgusting to look at while you eat. Feels worse than hooters. The only thing that keeps me coming back is the great food.", "Came in here for a quick lunch, service was fast and friendly, food had variety and was tasty.

The crutide salad was like the staple salad I had in Chalon, France, albeit the carrots and celery were diced rather than chopped. The sturgeon over spinach was good in the provincial sense, but the potatoes detracted from that because they were overcooked. As to the gelato, the white peach, dark chocolate, and hazelnut were rather authentically Italian, as I remember during my most recent visit to Florence.The menu appears to be provincial, which means the dishes aren't creamy and highlighted with rich sauces.

Granted I didn't pay but I did take a peek at the prices and they have a prix fixe menu for only $32! I definately will be back to take advantage of that!The only part of my very special Christmas gift I did not like was it did take the waiter a good 10 minutes to bring us the dessert menu and he seemed rushed and not too friendly.

But my first and only experience at La Petit Folie on NYE this year was so appalling bad, I felt compelled to write. To put it bluntly, this was quite possibly my worst experience in a restaurant. It had nothing to do with the food, but, rather, the service. More specifically: the waiter, who was one of the rudest people I have ever met, and openly mocked my family for their lack of knowledge about French food and terms.For example, my mother asked about the differences between the cheeses and the waiter looked at her as if she were completely ignorant, before sneering, \"They're all made of milk.\" At first I thought maybe he had a really strange sense of humor, but he ultimately ignored her question, and made similar condescending remarks throughout the evening. He even openly mocked my grandmother when she mispronounced \"frisee.\" In all my years of service at various places of employment, at no time and in no place would that have been appropriate behavior.Luckily for our waiter, we had a table of 7 so he was able to add the automatic 18% gratuity, which, on NYE, was a hefty sum around $150. It infuriated me that he felt that he could so blatantly disregard us as customers--or even just as people!--because he knew he didn't have to work to earn a good tip. I passed him talking to a 3-top on my way back from the bathroom, and he was smiling and shmoozing and generally coming across as a pleasant human being. Maybe this is the cynic in me, but I'd bet his Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde act had something to do with the fact that he couldn't charge this table automatic gratuity. Admittedly, this was just one server on one evening, but it was just so disappointing to have such an awful dining experience on New Years Eve, after what had been a very difficult year for my family. It was supposed to be celebratory, and ended up mostly uncomfortable and embarrassing. If this is the type of person that La Petite Folie typically employs, it does not reflect well on management's hiring or training processes. Needless to say, I will not be returning to find out whether this was a fluke, or the norm. The food was absolutely delicious and the proprietor/chef seems wonderful, but, frankly, it costs way too much to feel patronized and mocked throughout the entire meal.If you do end up going to La Petite Folie, you might want to steer clear of the waiter with dark brown hair and a short-cropped dark brown beard and mustache. Dude's got a huge chip on his shoulder about something!!", "We had been to La Petite Folie many years ago, and were pleased to have a chance to try it again when we were in the area recently. It is a charming place with serene d\u00e9cor, good music at an appropriate level, and gracious service. The food was about as we recalled, enjoyable, \"A-OK.\"The bread service, a good baguette, was very tasty. For starters, my onion tart was flavorful -- but disappointingly limp, with no crispiness at all. The evening's soup, an artichoke puree, was well-executed, but one-dimensional. My sirloin tips were not really tips as I've known them, but rather slices; really OK, but not distinguished. My companion's fish of the day was fresh and nicely done. For dessert, I liked a chocolate tart: good flavor, nice texture, appealing presentation; an apple tart was somewhat of a clumped-up affair, but passable, according to my companion. Cappuccino was excellent. The all-French wine list is admirable, with many choices from each appellation.There were enough misfires that I can't say it's outstanding, but La Petite Folie has a lot to recommend it.

The tacos are prewrapped and placed in warming bins according to the meat contents. Each taco is $2 and there's a condiment bar with all the fixin's. Pico and guacamole are extra (but worth the 35 cents, or whatever it was) and can be found near the cashier. For a prewrapped taco, they were pretty decent. All the tacos are corn tortilla so the later you are getting one the more likely you'll get a soggy yet dry taco. So get there early for the best results!Like all the other reviews have mentioned, everything is homemade and all the produce is fresh. They had homemade pumpkin bread ice cream sandwiches, how could I resist? I got one to go and it was still in great shape after my 15 min walk home. Once again, for being made hours ahead of time, it was pretty tasty. Other than tacos on Tuesdays, they have specials all week. The menu is posted near the condiment station. They also have sandwiches, salads, and burgers. For a simple, fast, and fresh lunch, give it a go!", "I got the Veggie Panini and it was awesome. my friend got the Blackened chicken sandwich and hers was insane. This place is cafeteria style but you can tell they put a lot of thought and mega skills into the food.", "Best food in Hyde Park, by far, and home to some of the best sandwiches I've ever had in Chicago.

Delicious and fresh, with crispy and lush textures working together beautifully. These guys know how to do it right!", "Good for breakfast and lunch. Great soups, deli sandwiches and salads. My favorites are the cheeseburger and kale salad. The price is crazy affordable considering the amount of food you get.", "Went there for Taco Tuesdays, and it really is as good a deal as everyone says it is. The tacos were flavorful and come in two corn tortillas with some vegetables for toppings and guac/pico for $0.35 each. It's a cheap meal, and the cafe next door gives you coffee for $1 if you have your own mug. I'd definitely stop by again, and the service was great.", "While this IS a seminary cafeteria, it's no typical \"school cafeteria\"! \u00a0There are CHEFS here who keep things fresh and always quality. Salads, soup, sandwiches, a grill, and various daily specials are only some of the wonders you find here. Taco Tuesday's are a consistent, especially in a neighborhood that has NOT ONE good place for tacos! \u00a0They \u00a0recently started having an occasional stir fry bar that rules!!I'm a stickler when it comes to my meals and this place is always on point! \u00a0 Only open during week days and really only for breakfast and lunch.

But if you're in the area, it's worth checking out. The food is fresh and inventive, with a steady rotation of interesting specials. The price is really good, especially for the quality. I'm told they're making more and more of the food completely from scratch. It is housed in a school of theology and is a non-profit so the cafeteria space is not fancy, at all. But it's good and honest food. For sure check it out.

Great, high-quality food for exceptionally reasonable prices. \u00a0Also, they've just recently opened a coffee bar which beats Starbucks' prices and serves better, fair trade coffee. \u00a0They go out of their way to use locally-grown ingredients and all of their take-out ware (to-go boxes, napkins, etc.) is biodegradable.If you're a UC student looking for a new lunch spot, or are just in the area looking for a solid meal for not much money, check out the refectory.", "Easily one of the best breakfast and lunch spots in Hyde Park. You can't beat the dedication and love that the staff puts into their work. Taco Tuesday is a must, and don't forget those flatbreads. \u00a0I stop by every morning to pick up my spot of coffee, and sometimes they even throw in a shot of espresso. \u00a0Also, the below average prices make it even better!", "This is a great breakfast and lunch spot. The food is some of the best in Hyde Park, and the prices can't be beat. The seating leaves something to be desired (mostly shared cafeteria style tables), but the amazing food and low ($6-7) prices make up for it. It's also great for takeout. It's in a seminary, but is open to the public.", "Fresh food and affordable prices. It's always good to support a non-profit. Loved their siesta burger!", "I would say 'hidden treasure' is pretty accurate in regards to the refractory. The food is all around the best I've had (taco Tuesdays are to die for). If you are looking for good deli sandwiches, this is the place!What makes it special though, are the chefs. Playful and friendly, they complete the experience. Don't be why, it's worth the adventure into the seminary quad.", "I've been here a couple times now. I deliver all over the city and could be anywhere from Naperville to Gurnee to Hyde Park come lunch time. This gem was a great find. The menu isn't the same every day but you can almost always get a sandwich if that's what your looking for. The only thing you have to be in the mood for is good food. There is a lot to choose from and usually some kind of home-made cupcake or cookies to choose from for dessert. Price is great too, you get a lot to eat for about the same amount you'd spend at a fast food place and a lot of times you're paying even less.

Since I have never had chicken and waffles before that day, there was nothing stopping me from getting it.Their wings are very well seasoned, a little overly salty but I had no qualms since it was a perfect complement to the large, warm and fluffy waffle. Those wings come piping hot and crispy, and with every bite I thought to myself how much tastier these wings are than the ones at BWW.

The negatives did not outweigh the positive, so that's why I rated it 4/5.The place smelled of incense, and the aesthetics are subpar. Don't go here for the ambience, go here because you want to eat lots of Chinese food.Pros: Big portions, Delicious EntreeCons: Ambience, Side dish may be a little salty for some (at least at that time, might be different for some).Overall: Inexpensive Tasty and Plentiful Chinese Food.", "So far the Mai Tai and the Long Island is on point!!!!!

I have ridden past this place at least 900 times and never ventured in until this past Saturday afternoon. I met a friend here for lunch after a volleyball game at the beach. I was pleasantly surprised to see live patrons, as this place looks like a mausoleum from the outside. The bartender was very nice and welcoming along with the patrons, who seem to be regulars. We had the fried tilapia, sesame chicken and szechuan shrimp. Everything was hot and fresh, but the tilapia took the cake. I normally don't eat my tialpia fried since it is such a delicate fish, but this was perfection. The bartender told me that it was fried in cracker meal. Loved It!

The decor is old and basic, but the food does the job. The menu has something for everyone, and there is a bar. It's a decent option for a relatively slow area of town.

The rice is good, though I feel that it's a little pricey for something I wish was included. The samosas are not my favorite. I find them to be heavy and oily. I have not tried any of the soul food. My only real complaint is I wished they served naan or parantha; their roti bread is just not as good. Service: Always courteous and quickly delivered.Ambiance: Has been newly renovated, which is nice because it does feel like a place you could now sit down in.

I wouldn't go out of my way to visit, but I am happy to have this place in the neighborhood.", "It's Indian food for non-Indians or for people who may not be too familiar with the complexity of Indian food. The owners are odd people, very nice to their white or black customers, not so great with Indians whom they regard with some strange sense of distrust (perhaps understandable from their point of view, given that most Indians are likely to be unimpressed by their blah food). A couple of the staff members are nice to everyone, but the main owners are... odd. They tend to freeze up every time I ask for something, and the owner once made a fuss because I dared to ask for a plastic bag, loudly complaining to his wife about it. \u00a0He wasn't fussing for ecological reasons, he was just annoyed that he had to slide his hand five inches over and get me a plastic bag. I *know* he wouldn't have done that to one of his white customers. \u00a0The dude has some major problems, and I cringe every time I get him at the counter, never knowing what mood he might be in. It's much too expensive for what is essentially a fast-food place. \u00a0The price on this Yelp page needs to change -- their prices also went up after their recent renovation, and they were never cheap to begin with. I've had several different Indian dishes there and all of them taste essentially the same. \u00a0The dishes tend to be too sweet -- almost everything is cooked with some amount of sugar. \u00a0The parathas are tired, as is the rice. Their televised/digital menu is silly -- it keeps changing so you can't really just look at it and decide. \u00a0It's part of their big makeover, and they should just dump it and stick to a traditional board. Inevitably, you have to get one of their paper menus from the counter or stand there and ask about the options, which only creates a bigger roadblock. \u00a0They have seats at the window now, but you can only really use one during the busy hours because of how they're set up. \u00a0Basically, if you sat next to the window, you'd have someone's ass in your face if they used a window seat. Things to try: Their chai, which is really, really good -- it's actually masala chai, and piping hot, with actual spices. Samosas: Nothing like what you get at Shan, but what is? \u00a0They're shaped into crescents and the dough can sometimes be too thick, but the filling is not too bad, and it's good and spicy. But overpriced. Their Cajun/soul food might be better than the Indian food -- I tried the chicken once, and it was surprisingly good, with a batter that was as well seasoned as the chicken. The mac and cheese was slippery, but that's inevitable given that it sits under the heat lamp all day long. Their fruit juices -- lychee, gauva and some other flavours -- are made from mixes but quite yummy.I always regret eating a full meal there. \u00a0It's a place I go to with friends when we just want a little nosh and maybe some tea or some drinks. And I try to ignore the rudeness of the owners. It's a pity that Hyde Park, which has a high concentration of South Asian people and a global community of people who are familiar with Indian food, doesn't have a better option.", "I have been going to Rajun Cajun for over 5 years and nothing compares to it. It is a very casual environment, great to grab and go or for delivery too. The owners are incredibly sweet, and you can tell it is a beloved restaurant by the postcards that hang on the wall from customers all over the world. This is some of the best Indian in Chicago. The butter chicken is perfect, with juicy tender chicken chunks and a creamy curry sauce. The samosas are cooked to perfection, and the palak paneer is delicious too. Don't love Indian food? The great thing about Rajun is that it is not limited to Indian, with fried chicken, Mac & cheese and apple pie for dessert.Without a doubt, Rajun Cajun is a neighborhood gem.", "We love this place and get carry out here very frequently.

However, the price seems to be expensive given that it's a fast food setting with mediocre setup. So, I would say that if you're on a budget, I don't think it's worth to try.

Went around noon on a Sunday and there were only two other customers when we first got there, with a steady stream thereafter.I was surprised to see the menus flashing on two big TVs behind the counter and that all the food was premade. It's like fast food but at close to regular Indian food prices. I was a bit hesitant about the setup but ultimately trusted Yelp and ordered a butter chicken combo with saag paneer and an extra eggplant & potato on the side.Portion sizes were not huge, but Indian food never is, nor does it need to be. More importantly, everything we ordered was quite tasty. Spices and sweetness levels were on point.The place is a Hyde Park tradition for a reason. All of the postcards printed on the ways (presumably part of the remodeling) attest to all its happy customers over the years. Count me as another one.", "Ok so this is not authentic indian food in my opinion but it is still good! The owners are sweet and my favorite is their CHAI!

Still I liked it and would order again.we also tried their tandoori chicken--that was a good .Overall I liked this place for the area and cheap priceAlso the owners were partaking in a tv competition \u00a0as I overheard--how cool!", "If you are looking for a large order for catering, this is definitely your spot that will not break your bank but you may have SO much food you will be looking for a food bank afterward to give out the leftovers! I am not kidding. Our group ordered food for 20 people, and I swear the amount of food we got could have served at least 60! So hooray for generous food portions for catering! And the delivery came on time, the food was hot, and they were super easy to work with too. We got a bunch of samosas which were only so so for someone who has had quite a few samosas in her day, but their chickpea chana masala curry with spinach was probably my favorite thing we got. It had a lot of flavor and I found myself grabbing a little extra of this on my round two of trying to eat all of the food that was delivered. Their paneer dish was so so as well and their tandoori chicken was decent, but I like my tandoori really spicy and I didn't quite get that. But all of that said, the food was good, everyone in our group loved it, and there is no way anyone could possibly be hungry after how much you will get at this place!", "As an indian myself, I know what the cooking is supposed to taste like.

We were a little off put by the glowing neon sign, but decided to head in anyway.After immediately opening the door, a wave of incense hits you. You can see the serving area where they have the food heated for who knows how long. We each ended up ordering different items such as samosas and curry. I opted for vegetarian dishes like the chickpeas and the saag paneer. The dishes had a lot of spices, and I thought the saag paneer was pretty good. However, I don't know if I'd come back here. First, I don't know how long the food has been sitting in the buffet. Also, I'm pretty sure most of us had stomach aches after eating.

Better than I've tried to make at home and my veggies, which normally don't taste well at restaurants, were also great. My mom got the chicken enchilada soup and it was so flavorful.

Was so courteous and offer us to have a drink ( soda ;) \u00a0) while we waited. I'm writing this review mainly for him. His customer service was top notch. Welcomed us with a smile and acknowledged everyone at the restaurant.

I always get the same thing, half chicken, garlic spinach, and loaded mash/roasted potatoes. I always ask for the chicken with the darker skin as it is the most flavorful. The cream spinach is also good according to my son. He once got the stuffing and did not like it.I can only review the items I mentioned as those are the only ones I have tried.

TODAY Amy was the one I dealt with. I placed an order...Once I told her my meats she informed the \"carver\". She asked me for my sides and then WALKED away to put a box away or something.(no gloves)... Then I had to ask her if I could place another order. (I've never had to do that, usually I am ASKED would I like anything else). She made my food again no gloves. She then TOSSED MY food and biscuit to the cashier. While ringing me out the cashier was leaning on the counter. She had to keep asking the girl what I ordered so I just answered for her. The whole experience was not welcoming and looking at the staff I have never seen any of them. The carver had on a pink shirt usually there is a guy there and he is dressed for business. The entire staff on 7/29/2014 around 830pm was a hot mess and ghetto. Their appearance was not what I am use to seeing when I visit this location. \u00a0From their demeanor I can tell they just have this a job for a paycheck. They don't take pride in their branch.

There also always seems to be something broken or dirty near the soda machine area. Sometimes there's quite a line of people waiting. I guess I feel the line could move faster if the employees had a better system for fulfilling orders. Sometimes it seems the cook is trying to take an order from the back of the kitchen, but the person actually filling the orders doesn't say a word. Not sure how that's efficient? Whatever.Other than that, we've had no problem. My husband actually recommends this place sometimes when we are looking for a quick meal.The corn bread is delicious and so are the pot pies. That's usually what I get. I've also had the quarter and half chicken meals in both dark and white meat. They were good.Cinnamon apples are also a guilty, occassional pleasure for me. Only thing I don't like here is the mac and cheese. It's a little on the nursing home, bland side.They recently changed their drink sizes and the medium/large size is absolutely huge.

The soondubu is always a safe (and delicious) choice. \u00a0I also like the yukgaejang, kimchi fried rice and kalguksu. \u00a0The bibimbap is just ok for me. \u00a0The other, meat-forward entrees I'm too cheap to try. :/", "Hyde Park isn't exactly a Mecca for good Asian food and Cafe Corea is the singular exception to a lot of boring, badly-spiced options. \u00a0The restaurant itself is very simple. \u00a0You walk in through two sets of doors that inexplicably open in opposite directions, meaning you can't open one while the other is open. \u00a0There are tables with no decor, just white. \u00a0Part of the kitchen is visible. \u00a0There isn't a ton of seating room but you could bring a group here.The banchan is very yummy and usually consists of one or two potato dishes, a zucchini dish or broccoli dish, and kimchi. \u00a0The flavor is always excellent.My favorite #1 item on the menu is the suntofu (soondubu) jiggae with tofu and veggies. \u00a0It's SO good -- it comes out literally boiling with an egg cooking in the middle. \u00a0The flavor is phenomenal and bursts in your mouth with every taste. Other things that I have really enjoyed include the bulgogi and galbi. \u00a0They're so well-spiced and cooked. \u00a0They're quite expensive so I don't order them often but when I do, they taste delicious. However, I do not like the chicken bulgogi, which does not have a good or rich flavor to it and is kind of boring and bland.The kimchi bokgumbap is creative and really delicious. \u00a0The bacon in it adds a lot!I love LOVE the haemool Jun. \u00a0they are not stingy with their seafood at all and the pancakes are HUGE! \u00a0I could get these as my entree!What has disappointed me was the bibimbap -- the vegetables were boring, bland, and overcooked. \u00a0I added a lot of red sauce to this to try to make it better but it just wasn't special. \u00a0The service here isn't great. \u00a0It's a family establishment with the husband working the service. \u00a0He never refills water - I always have to go up and ask - and doesn't really check on his tables. \u00a0We once sat for twenty minutes before anyone took our order. \u00a0Regardless, the food is so great and this is my favorite place to eat in Hyde park and some of my favorite simple, classic Korean around.", "I was very disappointed by this place. I love Korean food and I have been to countless restaurants that serve much better food than this place. The food did not taste very authentic and all the meat dishes were so bland and poorly cooked. In addition, it was very pricey for small portions. If you are looking for Korean you are much better off going somewhere else.", "There is a monopoly on Korean food in Hyde Park- so maybe this is why quality and quantity are poor. I paid $17 for a half-cooked egg and some rice that barely covers one takeout box- this price is ridiculous and much too expensive! They are not organic etc to be charging this price! Do not go!", "Comfy, cozy, Corea.Yes, I know Korea is spelled with a \"K\" and I'm sure the owners do to, but I just love going to this place. It's a small place with a tiny kitchen and almost zero amenities (the bathroom is a tiny place up some stair by the restaurant's office. I love the fact that we almost always end up having a conversation with the table next to us and with floor to ceiling windows you get some great street watching. While I'm not of Korean descent, my wife is, and this place has met her approval on all but one dish she thinks they use to much pepper in. In the over ten years we've been going here I've never had a bad meal. Don't let the tininess scare you away. It's a wonderful place to eat and one of the maybe two Korean places on the south side.", "Good honest Family run Korean restaurant. The food is fabulous fairly priced. It a gem in Hyde Park area. It bring culture and diversity where it is needed. I liked their spicy pork bulgogi on a sizzle plate and their stone bowl bibmingbop.", "Went later on a weeknight and it was pretty empty, so I got great service. \u00a0Ordered the bibimbap with beef, a signature Korean dish. \u00a0I didn't particularly like the red/chili pepper sauce they provided so the dish lacked true flavor since the beef wasn't seasoned very much. \u00a0But the plating was great with a nice, over-easy egg on top. \u00a0It also came with 4 sides, including kimchi, bean sprouts, a squash medley (I think), and some seasoned potato slices (delicious).It's a small hole-in-the-wall operation run by 2 people, that produces some quality Korean food, which you can't find anywhere else nearby. \u00a0I'd give it 4 stars, but the prices are high even for Hyde Park standards. \u00a0Also the first couple pages of the menu have the really expensive options so start from the back.", "Cafe Corea is one of my favorite restaurants.One time, I was here alone reading a book. I got my first-ever hot stone rice bowl, and poked at it. The owner came over and said, \"No no no. You have to do it like this.\" He took my spoon and chopsticks out of my hands, and stirred the contents vigorously, so they would cook evenly and not stick to the sides. And I liked it. He's also told me how much pepper sauce I should add to different dishes once or twice. He's like the food-savvy uncle we all wish we had.Every menu item I've tried has been great, hot and cold. Also, they give these four small/tantalizing pickle dishes as appetizers, and mochi ice cream is available for dessert.This is a good place to bring yourself, your date, or your parents.", "The food here is so flavorful. The spot is small and cozy. \u00a0I went for lunch on a saturday. My friend and I were the only people there. The owners were nice and helpful. The food was fresh and the service was relatively quick. I had the beef tofu jigae and it was awesome. My friend had the beef bibimbap and loved it. I only wish they gave more sides with everything. I would definitely \u00a0recommend this place to people looking to try korean for the first time. Will be going back very soon.", "Place to go when craving Korean and everywhere else is too far away from Hyde Park. I've always gotten the seafood pancake and seafood soondubu here. The portion sizes are fine but the prices are a little high but not too bad. Service is fine but the place is really small so it can get very crowded. Definitely just a place to go to satisfy a Korean food craving.", "I've been here numerous times over the past few years and have never had a bad experience. Service can be slow at times, especially around dinner time, but it's understandable considering the small staff they have working this place.I always get the noodles in the soup with seafood. So good, especially on a cold winter's day. The squid/octopus pancake is delicious and highly recommended as well.", "Seoul Corea is a lovely small Korean restaurant that is well worth a visit. The space houses 10 or so small tables in a friendly and pleasant atmosphere. The bibimbap is excellent, as is the dolsot bibimbap, and the ghalbi. The kitchen is eager and happy to oblige any dietary restrictions and happily has made several of my orders of bibimbap with tofu or even without a specific protein. The prices are also quite reasonable. In short, it's an excellent neighborhood Korean restaurant and a good addition to Hyde Park's restaurant scene.", "So I have never had Korean food before I went to Seoul Corea. Luckily, I accompanied my friend who spent the last 7 years living in Korea and recently moved back to the US. She speaks pretty good Korean and was able to tell me what to order and what people living in Korea actually eat.After a bit of explaining she told me to get the Bibimbap that came in the cast iron type skillet. That way you food was still cooking when it came out. We also ordered a few dumplings to split between the two of us. While we were waiting for food, I tried kimchi for the first time along with a few other little appetizer type things which are supposed to compliment your meal according to my friend.Not much later our food came out. My Bibimbap was sizzling. I enjoyed mixing the egg along with the vegetables and rice together with the red chili sauce. According to my friend the food was decent.The prices were ok for Hyde Park. I am glad that my friend found a Korean place on the southside that she likes! Next stop Korean BBQ.", "Wonderful authentic Korean restaurant. It's a mom and pop shop. The owners are really nice. Food is excellent! I highly reccomend!", "As a first time visit, I had seafood soon-du-boo jjigae. It was beyond my expectation. Small dishes were great too.

The Ja' Grill location in Lincoln Park had a bit more authenticity to it. The Hyde Park location seems to be holding back a bit, and part of that may be to pander to the local palates.The curry chicken was tender, but very mild in flavour. The rice and beans didn't have the hint of coconut milk in it that I was accustomed to tasting when eating my grandmother's cooking. I must admit that the coco bread mentally transported me back to Negril. Also, the curry soup was a plus for the cold weather we'd experienced in Chicago.I give high marks on the service.

For a match up between Uncle Joe's and Ja' Grill, scroll to the bottom. Appetizer: My patty took awhile to get and then appeared to be microwaved! I know the difference. I bake mine and patron other Jamaican bakeries and was sad to have paid $4 plus tax and tip for a microwaved dish. The outer texture of the dough and the sunken center were the immediate clues to a microwaved dish.Entr\u00e9e: I ordered the large jerk chicken dish, because why only get two pieces for $12 when you get an half chicken meal for $14? I really liked their cabbage, but everything else was ok. The peas and rice were dry so I used jerk sauce on them and the three small plantains were also dry. The plantains are more of a garnish then an actual included side. The chicken was actually very tender, but lacked the flavor I was expecting so I just dumped more jerk sauce on it.Dessert: I ordered the apple caramel bread pudding. It was the best thing they had out of everything I ordered! It is a big portion and the caramel sauce is just sweet enough and not too thick. Well done.Staff: The hostess was nice, but clearly overwhelmed trying to manage her station and assist the servers. My waitress was kind, but may have been only one or two servers on duty on a busy weekend afternoon. From what I've read, this seems to be a consistent issue when dining here. Needless to say service was slow, but they tried to be attentive.Environment: The layout of the tables and hostess/host stand is awkward. I was seated by the door, which meant people had to come through my table to get out, while I was eating. The decor is nice and vibrant and the ambiance elevates their overall rating. I just think they need to re-structure the table layout and host stand. Overall, I would revisit knowing the food to be of C+ or B- quality. The ambiance and location is an A. The dessert also gets an A.

Starting from the door, \u00a0a friendly waitress came and greeted me right away and allowed me to sit anywhere I desired as I waited for my guest to join me. \u00a0She immediately came over with a menu and glass of water and stated that if I wanted anything while I waited she was more than happy to get it for me. \u00a0I appreciated her willingness to be accomodating while I waited for my other party. \u00a0So after my other party arrived, \u00a0she came back and immediately introduced us to the specials along with providing her honest option on the entrees. \u00a0She was so good, \u00a0she didn't need a pen and paper to remember anything. \u00a0We started with the Honey & Jerk Wings and Beef Patty! DELICIOUUUUUUSSS!!!! OMG. \u00a0We accompanied our meal with drinks a Rum Punch for me a Long Island for him. We were pleased with the strength of our drinks. \u00a0I'm definitely feeling it as I type this review. \u00a0From there we had our entrees Lamb Chops, \u00a0Jerk & Curry shrimp, Cabbage, Plantains and Rice & Beans. \u00a0Every bite was heaven!!!!

So I was eager to try this popular place. \u00a0It was hopping all the tables were occupied and it was busy. \u00a0We just missed the rum tasting. \u00a0Darn.So there was three of us. We lucked out and got the last open table. \u00a0The cocktails were well done. The wine list is essentially non-existent. The food was just okay. \u00a0My wife had the catfish and it was baked not fried. \u00a0It was okay but not something to come back for. I had the curried goat that was easily half gristle. \u00a0What I had was decent but light on the curry. \u00a0After mentioning it to the waitress, she said that a lot of people had returned the goat.. \u00a0Why would you wait until after serving the goat would you tell a guest? \u00a0They offered to comp us dessert but we had had it. \u00a0They did not discount the food. ( A sign of poor focus on pleasing your customer. Especially if a lot of folks had the same reaction.) \u00a0Service was okay. \u00a0Had to wait for 15 minutes for a drink to arrive.", "Everytime I go to Chi-town I try to get to Ja'Grill. Service is always great. Yummy food, great portions and awesome music. The food is seasoned well and I love that I can combine the platters b/c it's really hard to choose between goat curry and jerk chicken (I don't think it says it on menu but they allow it when I ask w/ an upcharge). The plantains are great as are the beef patties. Good place for groups too.", "Four family members decided to dine at Ja'Grill on a Tuesday evening. \u00a0We arrived around 5:30 p.m. and were seating right away. The restaurant was 1/2 full but by the time we left it was completely full with people waiting by the door. \u00a0Our waiter, Steven, \u00a0was excellent. \u00a0Very helpful in explaining the menu choices and offering drink advice. I had a combination plate of jerk catfish and chicken. \u00a0It was very good. \u00a0Their cabbage was excellent and the rice and beans were as well. \u00a0The portion size was average. I would say that the waiting time from ordering to our food being brought to the table was just a little longer than normal but not exceptionally bad. \u00a0I think the seating is too close for this small restaurant. \u00a0You can hear everybody's conversation in front of you, in back of you.....just all around. \u00a0I complained to my son that the place was too noisy for me and he said that's because it's a bar and grill. \u00a0Well I've been to bar and grills before but the noise level at this place was just awful for me. \u00a0I couldn't enjoy our conversation because it just seemed to intermingle with all the other conversations in the place. \u00a0I don't like to talk loud but I felt I had to do that to be heard and after awhile I actually started getting a headache. \u00a0I was glad to leave and if I go back it will probably be for lunch and not dinner. \u00a0Maybe the lunch hour is a little quieter and not so cramped.", "Really cool Caribbean spot in Hyde Park first time here nice atmosphere. Outdoor, indoor seating and bar seating. Great for going out to have drinks and get a bite to eat. One of the first jerk restaurant I've been to that actually delivers what they described on the menu. Very casual spot near a small shopping center. The service was excellent. The food was really good for and appetizer we had a beef and curry chicken patty. My dinner was ribs rice and beans and cabbage. The ribs were super tender the rice and beans were the perfect texture the cabbage wasn't as tender or as seasoned to my likening but over all everything was really good. This is the only Jerk spot that has got and mild jerk sauce (thank you). I had the Lake Park rum cocktail which was super amazing I recommend to anyone who likes sweet drinks. I will go here again I really want to try the jerk Catfish.", "I'm definitely a fan. \u00a0I had the tilapia curry and it was delicious. \u00a0I look forward to going back.", "3.5!!I've been twice. The first time I wasnt impressed. Got the jerk chicken , it could have been better , kind of dry. The specialty drinks aren't that great. Second time I got the jerk catfish , way better .

Especially for the price. $10 for a large jerk dinner is a pretty good deal.. My only problem is that my food took 2 hours to arrive and wasn't hot, the cabbage was actually very cold! The Mac & cheese looked like they tried to doctor up some box Kraft Mac & cheese, it didn't look homemade.

It is basically across the street from the museum of Science and Industry, so makes a great stop after seeing the sights. \u00a0They have a traditional Italian dinner menu as well as tapas selections for smaller plates. The food we had was delicious. The datiles con torino \u00a0(bacon wrapped dates) were plump, crisp, juicy, and delicious. The carbonara was a treat. The fettuccini apulliana was well executed. And I've never had a dish quite like the gnocchi ripieno \u00a0(dumplings with roasted red peppers, olives, and capers). \u00a0The gnocchi were pillowey soft, and were stuffed with red pepper cheese filling! All doused with a light butter garlic sauce. The tiramisu was as good as expected from an Italian restaurant. The flan was mediocre, but had a nice orange flavor. And the coconut iced cream was a nice light treat. The ambiance is nice, but not stuffy. Nice glassware, but still paper table cloths. There are nice views from the ground level arched windows. Adding some light background music would help break the quiet.We were pleasantly surprised by this place, and glad we gave them a try.", "It was good. Food=Not fantastic, not bad... just good. (fried calamari was very good)Service=greatConvenience=awesome, after a day at the museum. Don't think I would go out of my way to go here but would definitely go back the next time we visit the museum.", "Lunched here today for the first time with my sister (after visiting the Museum of Science and Industry). We were very pleasantly impressed. The atmosphere is very nice, with white paper-covered table cloths and tall windows with arched tops, so the whole dining room is filled with light, and beautiful views of the park abound. Wait service was attentive and extremely nice. Menu has a generous offering of varied selections, with an emphasis on pastas. Many salad and sandwich options, too. Prices vary, with some dishes over $20, but an ample selection of moderate-priced entrees, in the low teens range. Soup, salads and sandwiches are even more affordable.We each had a pasta dish; mine was an ear-shaped pasta cooked with mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes in a creamy pesto sauce. Wait time for food was very reasonable...probably within 10 minutes. My dish was very tasty, if maybe overly rich (my fault for choosing a pasta in a cream sauce) and clearly all of it was very fresh. I took half of my entree home and it was a nice treat for dinner this evening. One extra-authentic Italian touch is a bottle of olive oil for bread plates to moisten bread (also fresh in Italian style) as an alternative to butter (which is offered, too). My sister was very pleased with her entree, too, which was gnocchi. Even though I couldn't finish my meal entree then, I couldn't resist ordering dessert after eyeing the bakery case in front. My sister and I shared a mini-chocolate-mousse-cake, and I ordered a cappuccino too. Espresso selections are ample. Our pastry was delightful! The mousse topping was sweetly creamy and light, with a rich chocolate taste. Most heavenly was the short layer of cake underneath the mousse, lusciously chocolate- tasting and unquestionably very fresh. I have one word: sublime. The cappuccino was excellent, too, with thick foam and a swirl of cinnamon. It was a little pricey at $4.50, but a better buy for the money than the souvenirs at the museum gift shop, LOL.My only complaint was the supposed parking provided for customers in a lot across the street. The parking situation was very confusing, with the only spaces vacant all designated as \"reserved for tenants\". I gave up and found metered street parking two blocks away. Inside the restaurant, I was advised I could've disregarded the signs and parked anywhere on the left side of the lot--but how would a new customer know that? Other than that, it was a thoroughly enjoyable dining experience in a community underserved in fast-food alternatives. Definitely, I will return next time I'm in Hyde Park, and will recommend enthusiastically to friends et al!", "Absolutely terrible!!! I have a food allergy and informed the server, Fransisco. When my food came out he handed me the plate and said don't eat the mashed potatoes. Didn't offer another side dish or didn't take it back and made a clean plate. Basically just said eat the meat and don't worry about it. The check came and the server didn't comp the meal. I will not recommend this place... Very poor customer service!!!", "As long as I have been in this neighborhood I never knew this place existed until today. Upon entering the restaurant you would walk right into a cafe.. Which I may go and try today. They had coffee and cakes etc. then the restaurant is right behind the cafe. The restaurant gave you sort of an upscale feel with its table setting and placements and large see thru windows. Let's talk about the food. They started us off with bread, butter and oils. Of course I made a Parmesan Cheese oil dip for my bread and it was yummy. We ordered the goat cheese, Mariana sauce with bruschetta and it was pretty good. The goat cheese was not strong like more of them can be. Then I ordered the lobster ravioli and it was amazing!!! Full of flavor in every bite and it wasn't fishy. You got real bits of lobster and not the imitation kind. My friend ordered the lamb chops with spinach potato and it was delicious. The lamb chop was cooked to perfection and it was not gamey like some lamb meat can be and the spinach potato was delicious. I would have never thought to combine the two. For dessert we had the grandma cake which I didn't to much care for. It was cold and dry in my opinion but that's just me. Overall I enjoyed this place and I wouldn't mind visiting again.", "The coffee is amazing, everyone who works here is super friendly, the desserts and pastries are to die for, and for how fancy this place is, everything is very reasonably priced. Items worth trying: spaghetti carbonara, cappuccino, tiramisu, tuna pinwheel, latte and more that I have yet to try.", "Adjectives: quality dishes, neighborhood gemDish: Duetto (ravoli and spaghetti with meat balls and meat sauce)I love this family-run Hyde Park gem. \u00a0It has that great Hyde Park mix of long-time HP hippies, rumpled UChicago students, and seniors who live in the building it is located in. \u00a0It is on the nice side of HP restaurants, but still pretty casual. (When I lived in the Windemere building, I have wandered down in my sweatpants to take advantage of the building discount.)The food is tasty and the portion sizes are generous for the price. \u00a0Their meat sauce is fresh and flavorful, so I recommend the duetto with meat sauce. You get some of the ravioli and some of their meatballs on one fabulous plate. \u00a0The wine list is compact.", "The food will get 5 stars, because it was delicious. The service, for the most part, was good. However, this is what made me give this restaurant 2 stars: my grandfather handed the waiter the tip, and the waiter refused to take it. My mom and I did explain to my 80 year old grandfather that the average tip is 15% of the meal because my 80 year old grandfather did not know. However, my grandfather insisted on our waiter taking the tip, and took it personal that the waiter just shrugged him off. My mother added a few more dollars to the tip (again to calm my grandfather down) and then my grandfather asked our waiter to come back and explain to us why he didn't take the tip. The waiter didn't say anything, took the tip, and then walked away abruptly while shrugging his shoulders. Overall, that waiter made it a bad experience. I did not appreciate him being rude. If you are a waiter, you should take any tip given to you. You need to realize that it can be insulting when you refuse a tip.", "I had lunch here for the first time yesterday. I had the pollo marinato alla griglia and it was simply amazing! I cleaned the plate & I never do that in public. Both the food and service were simply divine. I'll be back to visit this gem of Hyde Park.", "I have gone to Piccolo Mondo quite a few times in recent year since I live in Hyde Park. Last night I was terribly disappointed to find out that the owner apparently no longer allows one to bring their own wine for a corkage fee. Their wine list is just terrible so this always helped motivate me to go back. I think it will be my last time. Food is pretty good, but eating it with bad wine is no fun. Too bad. I tried to be loyal but there are so many other options in Chicago. Very dumb decision on the part of the owner.", "I was happy to find a second decent restaurant (i.e., a pleasant, conversation-friendly place serving good food that's worth what I paid) in Hyde Park. (The other place is La Petite Folie.) While Piccolo Mondo won't be earning Michelin stars any time soon, it is a comfortable venue serving tasty Italian standards in a light, airy setting. The staff was congenial, the service attentive (if a bit slower than some), and the prices acceptable. Another plus: free parking in their lot.The menu is mostly straight-ahead Italian, with an additional offering of hot & cold Spanish tapas. The wine list offers many choices, most at the lower end of the price spectrum ($25 - $30 bottles). We enjoyed a Piccolo Mondo salad for starters; it was fresh & nicely dressed. My companion liked a lamb chop special (tender & tasty), and I was pleased with a seafood mixed grill (the octopus, squid and shrimp were all fresh-tasting and nicely cooked). Portions were quite ample -- we had no room for dessert.I'll definitely go back when I'm in Hyde Park for a play or concert. HP is sadly lacking in decent restaurants, and PM is a bright spot for me.", "I loved the atmosphere and the food did not disappoint. Pleasant wait staff - A comfy yet upscale feeling all around. Delicious wine and dessert selection as well! What a legacy for the neighborhood.

What Contact Us page doesn't have the restaurant's phone number on it? The About Us page \u00a0has been under construction for years.

The cappuccinos were pretty good too. All in all, this place deserved a solid 5star rating :)", "I went here for Christmas Day (yeah, they were open) and had a good time. It was practically empty but that just made the service better -- attentive, but the server seemed unenthusiastic. Since it's an Italian restaurant I had to have fried calamari to start: not disappointed. My main dish was seafood spaghetti -- so good! \u00a0It had everything: shrimp, scallops, octopus, etc. It's a great place for a date or for families or friends, and on a sunny day it lets a lot of sunlight in. They have a BIG selection of desserts as well. I'll definitely go back.", "My parents met me here for a belated birthday dinner. The food was good, and the service was superb.

The place was empty when I arrived, I ordered a cheese burger with my beef. When I observed the young lady casually tossing ten fries in the deep frier, I asked if that was my order. I informed her the fries looked a little light. She replied you get a small order with the burger. I asked her how could she ensure it was a small order since she arbitrarily pick up some fries and tossed them in the basket. She refused to add more. From that point forward, the older lady working with her watched me with reckless abandonment. I don't know why, they were working behind a locked door and plexiglass. When I arrived at the house, I was very disappointed. The corned beef was very lean, but dry and lacking flavor. Usually the container is greasy from cooking process that gives the meat its unmistakable legendary flavor. I have purchased fatty meat, been given less than a pound of meat, but never given flavorless dry meat. The reason customers continue to patronize this place,regardless of the extremely exorbitant prices, is the unique flavor of the meat. High prices, less than stellar customer service, and unremarkable meat removes AP from the bucket list. No longer worth the trip.", "One of the best corned beef sandwiches ever. I've eaten here so many times I cant even count and there is a reason why! The portions of tender buttery corned beef that they fit on those 2 wee pieces of rye bread look impossible and you end up with more meat on your plate than your sandwich...but it is absolutely delicious. Get that with a side of fries or plain potato chips and you're in business. This location has odd hours (like not open on Sundays sometimes) which I can never remember and I end up getting myself all worked up for a sandwich and cant get one because they aren't open! That's a small mishap tho because I usually get one on a Friday or Saturday so I'm good. Also, this isn't a joint that you sit down and dine. These folks are packed in there in line (sometimes out the door) and they are on a mission: to get their sandwiches and be out. That's what you should do too.

Ha ha First the chicken was delectable even the day after! It was perfectly seasoned, soft, and better than any fried chicken that I've had except my aunts! Geez, I can't believe I was a vegetarian for a while last year. This chicken was so good I almost want to hunt for chickens and drop them off at Chicago's Home of Chicken and Waffles to get more! 2) I don't like waffles or pancakes. Typically after eating one bite I'm full and uncomfortable, but the waffles were thin and the batter was made out of something that happen to be easier to digest. These waffles were top notch! They give you two per order and it was the closest I've ever come to eating an entire waffle. Clearly it's not made out of the stuff that blows up in your tummy. 3) The sides - over easy eggs, and grits were also cooked to perfection. Yeeeeeeeeeessssss!!!When I placed my order on Seamless they stated that it would be delivered in 1-2 hours! Woah, that's a long wait for breakfast, but these people are very busy for a good reason. So, they actually delivered it within an hour, I was very happy with that. You will hear people complain about the wait, but generally places who can deliver in 20 minutes are not very busy. This places is on the south side and delivering to downtown in under an hour is impressive on their busiest day of the week so yeah there's a wait, but well worth it!", "Good just that \"Good\".If I was more into fried foods I would probably give this place 4.5The set up is average and it's a nice place to refer out of towners to.The waffles are extremely tasty and flavorful. The waffles are nice and thin but again very flavorful. I've always opted for the \"Kesha\" which contains two catfish filets fried to perfection alongside a waffle and a side of grits or potatoes.I'm not really a fan of the grits here as they are not smooth enough for me but did I mention THE WAFFLE is GOOD LoL.All three of my stars are based on the waffle, no wait I will also say the location it's so close to the expressway and McCormick place in the historical Bronzeville neighborhood.

The food is delicious, without a doubt! As good as my mother's food(she even said so herself when she was with me). The problem I had was with the wait to be seated and the wait I had last Wednesday for a take out order. Now, I won't lie. If I lived around the corner and knew I could get in relatively quickly on the weekends, I would be there all of the time. But since I live almost 20 minutes away, I'm not always willing to wait an hour plus for food, even if it is good. I understand that they're limited by space, but I have the option of going somewhere else just as good and getting seated in less than 15 minutes. My major problem was when I placed a call in order on a cold Wednesday night last week. I was told that my order would be ready in 15 minutes. I was close, so I just parked, waited the remainder of the 15 minutes, and waited an additional 10 minutes to be on the safe side. The place was practically empty. Maybe people at 6 or seven tables. The cashier was very pleasant, even though she and someone I assume was a manager had me wait to pay while they fumbled with a tablet and a plug. I eventually paid, was told it would be just a minute, and went to the ladies room. I expected my food to be there when I returned. It wasn't. I leaned against the booth thinking it was coming. I'd waited more than half an hour since I called and placed the original order, it had to be ready. I waited, and waited, and finally sat down in the booth. I guess I was forgotten because when I finally stood up angry, the cashier casually said, \"You didn't get your food yet?\" Let me stress, there may have been a total of 12 people there eating, and even though she couldn't see me over the top of the booth, I had been in her sight standing for almost 10 minutes before I sat down. She couldn't have forgotten me, but more importantly, my food still wasn't ready. Long story short, I waited an additional 15 minutes for my food for a grand total almost an hour for a take out order. I could have come in, sat down, and had a drink while I waited that long. There was really no point to calling.

I live down the street from Clarke's and have eaten here more than enough times.Food - 3.5 StarsIf I had to give this place a review just based on the food, I would give it 3.5 stars. Because it's not an upscale restaurant whose food should be ranked top 10 in Chicago, I can't, by any means, give it anything close to 5 stars. However, Clarke's is one of the better diners I have been to. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are served 24 hours a day, there are freshly made pastries, there is a turkey option, and the food is consistent. You can get 3 full course meals for under $30. Clarke's is like an off-brand IHOP with less pancake options, better tasting eggs, and burgers. The food quality is definitely on the better half of Chicago diners. Service - .5 Stars...Yes I said POINT 5 starsBefore I talk about this, please note that from December until now, the service has been excellent. They've hired some new staff like O and this white guy (forgot his name) who have been outstanding waiters. However, for the sake of the new owners making changes, I'll be writing this review for the time before December.I've been to my fair share of diners and restaurants, and let me tell you, Clarke's has some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced. When you first walk in, there's no host....at all. I've lived in Hyde Park for 2 years now, and, until December 2015, I've never been greeted a the door. Usually, my girlfriend and I wait about 2 minutes, get irritated, grab a few menus, and find ourselves a table. Then begins the waiting game. The busser is always helping with refilling our water glasses, but he's usually the only person we interact with for the first 5-10 minutes of stepping into the diner. Many times we're sitting by the TVs which is right in front of the juice bar where the staff is usually. So we can clearly see the staff looking at us waiting to have our orders taken. During one experience, we had our waitress come by, take our orders, clock out without placing our orders, and then wait another 20 minutes before anyone realized that our waitress had left and our orders were never placed. During another fantastic experience, 3 waiters/waitresses passed us by without taking our order. The white waiter (still can't remember his name), who was actually about to leave since his shift was up, went out of his way to ask someone to take our order. However, when they \"forgot\", he took off his coat, put down his bag, and offered to stay an extra hour to make sure we got our food. As soon as we did, I tipped him $20, and told him to leave because he shouldn't be burdened with his colleagues' terrible service or management. Lastly, it take FOREVER to get the check. Now, many are probably asking \"Why do you keep going back if the service is so bad?\" Well, considering I only live 5 minutes away walking, and it's the only place (besides Subway) opened 24 hours in Hyde Park, there aren't too many options after 10pm. Also, like a said, the food is actually pretty good. Since the beginning of December, I have seen some changes in personnel and the service has been soooo much better. I just hope the new owner can whip his manager into shape.Rant over.", "If I could give this place no stars or even negative stars, I'd gladly do so. I have never had such terrible service at a diner \u00a0in my entire history of having diner food. Diner food is never even that good to begin with, so to have this experience is really saying something. We (a party of 10, but one wasn't eating) arrived a little after noon and were seated quickly, which is good, but what was probably the one good thing that happened here.From then it took our server/waitress, at least 30 minutes to acknowledge us. Looked at our table a couple of times, but no one knew she worked there because she was dressed like she rolled out of bed after a real deep sleep and showed up in sleep clothes. By the time she finally acknowledged us to take orders, she stood at one end of the table and basically said \"who's ready to order\" in no particular order, not addressing anyone directly, in between orders she just says \"anyone else?\" Doing that is forcing us to shout our orders to you across the table. Good job for not taking 5 extra steps to move to the other side of the table to take orders. Maybe if you would have our orders would have been correct, but that must have been way too much to ask of a person we pay to provide a service.So with all of the orders in, we continue to wait an OBNOXIOUSLY long time for our food. Now it's understandable when you're a very large, super busy restaurant who provides something a little more complicated that chicken noodle soup and omelets, but again....maybe these are complicated orders. I think we waited, without further acknowledgement from anyone, for maybe close to an hour. To the point that we had to ask if we were forgotten. Maybe the order got lost, maybe they forgot and overlooked, but they assured us it's being made and they're busy so that's why it was taking so long.....I've seen busier places take care of our large group and still actually treat us like paying customers. So our food comes out and....let me tell you, the food seemed like it was cooked and sat there on the counter for 20 minutes before someone remembered to bring it out to us, like an afterthought. We got rice (from the burrito ) that was taken out of the fridge and served cold, an order of potatoes that seemed like it was cooked this morning and left under a slightly warm heat lamp to get soggy and slimy, an order of chicken noodle soup that came out very last, wrong orders, and missing food. So yes, some of the people in our hungover and super hungry group, regrettably, \u00a0ate what was remotely edible. Traded in then soggy potatoes for slightly less, but still soggy potatoes. We had them stick the rice in a microwave, cause rice isn't normally supposed to be served cold, but afterwards it ended up tasting like sadness, anyway. Had rye bread for a blt, but was given white, which would have never happened if my friend didn't have to shout across the table in an already not quiet diner to order it. Toast was ordered, but never dropped off. Now unless you were back there baking the bread from scratch, I don't understand how an ordet of toast could take more than 3 minutes to make, let alone never making it to the table in the hour and a half we sat there waiting. Even after reminding our waitress /server, it was still never brought out...So we ask to speak to a manager, who comes out like \"well it's busy, \u00a0the food is being brought out as it is being ready.\" Really? \u00a0We got half our meal at once, and not one thing was served hot. All room temp. So what were we waiting for, really? I find it hard to believe it took a blt just as long to be made as an omelet which takes the same amount of time as a burrito and they were all made simultaneously and came out at the exact same time. So she walks away without even letting us finish our complaints and goes to get some other guy, who knows who he is. He just walked up to us and says the same thing and they walk away. O....kay. lovely service that you can keep using that tired excuse, but not offer up any sort of apology or anything. Avoid this place like the plague. Avoid it like you'd avoid your nasty \u00a0stalker ex-something. Go across the street to Mello Yellow because, for a diner, they've always been solid in the service and food department. I have never, received such terrible service from any place in the industry as i did with this waitress, \u00a0manager, and whoever the guy was that never introduced himself.I'd give this place a -10/10, if I could.", "I am really surprised by the bad ratings here. \u00a0I have been many times, and never had a problem.We've always come for dinner. \u00a0Service isn't always super quick, but I don't think it's ever been terrible. \u00a0Everyone is always friendly and helpful.This is like a typical America diner. \u00a0They serve breakfast 24/7. \u00a0They have great deserts. \u00a0They have plenty of greasy tasty options. \u00a0They have big comfy booths. \u00a0I have had a few of their salads, and I thought they were all good. I'm impressed by how large they are, and how much real food and vegetables are on the salads. \u00a0I really like the Elk burgers here. \u00a0It's cool that you can add a fried egg to your burger for free. \u00a0I always get sweet potato fries as a side, and they're really good. \u00a0I am sad that they stopped serving the charlie brown brownie sundae, which was my husband's favorite desert in the city. \u00a0Last time they made us a sundae from a piece of chocolate cake, and that was good, but it wasn't the same.Overall I am really to have Clarke's in Hyde Park. \u00a0They're open 24/7, they have amazing deserts, you can come in and hang out with friends for a while, or come in with a laptop or a book and sit by yourself. \u00a0You can get a huge variety of food, so everyone will be happy. \u00a0They give you plenty of food for your money. \u00a0This is a solid place.", "Uh. Well........ it put food on my stomach.I came to Clarke's after I'd left from the Promontory seeing a comedian perform. If Promontory was still serving food, I would've stayed there. But since Clarke's is a 24 hour spot, I decided to wander down the block there.Got in and I wasn't sure if I was supposed to sit myself or wait for someone. There wasn't anyone there. Eventually someone came to the front and said that I had the choice to sit where I wanted. Fine.I sit.After sitting there for about 15 mins one of the waitresses finally comes and asks have I been served. Noooooo..... so she serves me. Water. That's a start. Thanks. After like 15 more mins, she finally comes back to take my order. Now I'm thinking that since I ordered some dip for an appetizer and a turkey burger, it shouldn't take that long. Wrong.After I started growing gray hairs, everything comes out together. *side eye* The dip was good but the burger. MEH!!!!! The turkey burger came with red and green peppers mixed in it which I wouldn't mind but it just didn't mesh well. I got through half of it. Waiting on my check was a whole nother hassle. Smh. I actually felt bad for the lady that was serving me because she was busting her butt alone pretty much. I won't speak too negatively because I'm sure that during a different time of the day it may be better but late night wasn't it. At all!!!", "My third visit in three days with extraordinary service and no waits at all. Today for lunch my kids watched as a manager made freshly squeezed OJ and he passed my 3 year old the glass - for free. I've read all the negative reviews but I've not experienced any of that. Plus the whole front of the restaurant opens up to the street. Very nice place and I highly suggest a visit.", "Where to start...I was in Chicago on business, and having visited Clarke's before I figured it was a safe bet. \u00a0Boy, was I wrong. \u00a0Joalton, my server, was clearly overwhelmed. \u00a0His herculean efforts to attend to me did not go unnoticed - the man is clearly extremely intelligent, hardworking, and diligent. \u00a0Were it not for him I'd rate zero stars, were that an option. \u00a0But good God, the management...How in the hell does a restaurant have one server for 6-9 tables during busy hours?I can't imagine what the management is thinking, other than they aren't, but this place is in a sad state of affairs.They desperately need to reevaluate their schedule, business model, and management if they hope to survive. \u00a0The only reason I'd ever bother coming back is the superb service I got from Joalton, but even then it would be a stretch.", "They serve breakfast 24-7!! Is there anything better to say?Skillet eggs are great. It is also THE place to crave something in Hyde Park after 10pm.", "Really terrible experience. There is no standard of appearance for the wait staff: our server was wearing yoga pants and you could see the top of her underwear. She also had dirt underneath her fingernails. She didn't write anything down for our order, which made me side eye because we had a few substitutions that she messed up twice when reading the order back to us. I had to ask for a refill on my drink, she completely messed up my friend's order, and referred to the chef in the back as \"retarded.\"The food was okay, nothing special. Spinach and artichoke dip was super funny. Toward the kitchen were seated what I can only guess were employees either on break or completely off the clock. They were talking loudly and our server engaged them much more than she did us. Service was slow even though there were only two other customers in the restaurant.I don't suggest this restaurant.", "I really hope management sees this but i doubt they would reach out. Clarkes is the only after hours dining option in hyde park and maybe that's why they think they can get away with poor service. Who is training the servers? They do not possess an ounce of tact and grace. I came late night as I have before but this time \u00a0instead of our food being out in minutes , it took nearly an hour. No one came to let us know service would be slower due to only one cook until our food came out. The waiter seemed nice just a little aloof. And after waiting what seemed like forever for service our exit was no pleasant experience either. \u00a0I've never been to a restaurant where you have to show proof of purchase before you leave. Not one time did our server mention that when we paid our tab, but a pretty aggressive \"security \" \u00a0guard was adamant on seeing proof. Communication people. That would have made this experience more bearable. I guess I'll have to travel out the neighborhood for late night eats because Clarkes will NOT get my money anytime soon", "I work on 53rd, I get breakfast across the street most days, the first time I got breakfast at Clarks, the service was slow and friendly (life story- it's ok if you let me eat type). Eggs Benedict was average to below, very little hollandaise sauce. The second, third and fourth time I got there, usually 6:40am, I had to walk out without service.  Here's why-5 minutes for the empty room servers to put down the cell phone, walk over, and let me know \"the cook is late\", \" the manager is not in yet\", and today, \" I'm actually off the clock waiting for the manager/server so I can take your order but I will have to wait for them to arrive...And, it's my last day working here.\" Seriously, it is the last time for me too.It's the laziest place I've ever experienced.", "This place is a funky mess. It's open 24 hours and was right up the block from our hotel so we decided to try it out. Big mistake. Started with a waiter that came back to our table 5 times to clarify our order (bad sign), the food took over 30 minutes to come out, a friend asked for egg whites and she did not get egg whites, but was still charged for it...the manager claimed they were egg whites but baked and that's why they looked yellow. WTF! Never heard that one before. He argued with us about this, even though our waiter accidentally admitted that he saw \"it did not look white.\" Under omelets it says $1.50 for each additional topping, but they charged me double that and said it was because that was the price for onions and tomatoes, not turkey sausage. Whatever. Finally, the food was absolutely flavorless. It was not good. We'll be staying by this hotel for 3 more days and we will make sure you never see another dime of our money. With bad food and horrendous service. I'm surprise you all have lasted this long.", "Amoooo este lugar! Gran comida y me encanta que abran las 24 horas! The skillet eggs are delicious I recommend it to everyone that needs a cozy place", "I'm starving, like stomach pains and I've had one to many bad experiences with this restaurant so I'd rather suffer the pain than waste another moment of my time here. The food is marginal at best and the service is worst. They don't even seem to care that the service is horrid.", "2.5 starsThis is hilarious but normally I don't read others reviews before I do my own, but I thought the food was actually terrible so I was really curious to see what others thought. \u00a0I should have check yelp before going here . I had wanted to go to Rajan Cajun, but my friend wasn't feeling that type of food so we randomly walk in here. Now here is the funny part I see so many reviews claiming the service is terrible.....and except for yes the slow wait to get food...I thought it was excellent! Our waiter was so friendly and he gave us various recommendations and was soooo patient with us (we were very indecisive)Okay though service is nice and all but I want good food! I was all excited getting to have my breakfast fix for dinner and order the Mexicana omelette. I barely took 2 bites..very bland and eggs tasted nasty. The steak fries and pancakes were good. The waiter was so nice I felt bad saying no need for a box (I'm not trying to kill myself eating that at home) My friend got the fish (I know right I plan on checking on her later) and she said it was okay.I won't be back but I really appreciate the hospitality, but I'm broke broke :( and need my meal to be filling, cheap, and good.", "Last time I will ever order here again, honestly I would rather eat grade D meat at McDonalds..Ordered pickup, showed up little after 5 mins they said the food would be ready, waited another 15 mins inside for it..Ordered the same exact burger as last time, completely the same, so it should look at least relevant to last time..That was not the case, a rare burger doesn't have room temperature, sticky, mushy, raw ground beef In the middle.. I could only take a couple bites around the edge of the burger before I was so disgusted and threw it away, it didn't even have good flavor, meat is bland. Incredibly dissatisfied.My friend's tomato soup was outrageously sweet for some reason, just not good at all. Weird clear stuff that almost looks like rice throughout soup, very off putting and just not very tasty. That was also thrown away. This was a last resort option for super late food, yet I'd rather stand inside the 7x10' box and wait 20 mins for some greasy McDonalds.", "I like the ambience here, very and quiet. Laid back even. The staff seemed a little delayed but friendly. I had the South of the Border breakfast skillet. Superb in looks and taste! The price was decent at 9.99. Another place coming highly recommended.", "Terrible service. Terrible food. Terrible experience. Truly a blight along the up-and-coming 53rd street strip in Hyde Park. Hopefully new and existing joints will extend their hours later into the evening so everybody can avoid this disaster.", "If I were to only base this review solely on food, Clarke's would receive three stars. But since service is so bad, they only get two stars. Service here is usually very slow; on multiple occasions, I have had to wait nearly 10 minutes for a waiter to take my order. Once they give you the check, you get to wait another 5 minutes before they pick up your payment.The food here ranges from mediocre to pretty good. For example, the pancakes have always been really warm and filling. I would argue that the pancakes are a major redeeming feature of this restaurant! But overall, the food doesn't seem well-made and resembles nicely presented left-overs (like the eggs Benedict).Another redeeming value of Clarke's would be that it's open 24/7. But other than that, it's a fairly mediocre restaurant.", "Terrible service. \u00a0Waited 30 minutes before a server even came to talk to us. \u00a0Waited another hour for food. \u00a0One of our party's food came cold...not room temperature...freezer cold. \u00a0Multiple pieces missing from meals. \u00a0Toasts, eggs, etc. \u00a0Potatoes came as a mush. \u00a0Management was rude and claimed it was because they were busy. \u00a0The restaurant is at 80% capacity. \u00a0Would not dine here again."], "rest_types": ["Diners,", "American (New),", "Pizza"], "price_range": "$11-30", "score": 2.38755980861244, "name": "Clarke\u2019s Diner"}, "72ZD4lVGj7nqdTlcclOsdA": {"long": -87.6295772, "lat": 41.7729151, "price_index": "$", "hours": {"Mon": {"open": "11:00 am", "close": "10:00 pm"}, "Wed": {"open": "11:00 am", "close": "10:00 pm"}, "Tue": {"open": "11:00 am", "close": "10:00 pm"}, "Thu": {"open": "11:00 am", "close": "10:00 pm"}, "Fri": {"open": "11:00 am", "close": "11:00 pm"}, "Sat": {"open": "11:00 am", "close": "11:00 pm"}, "Sun": {"open": "Closed", "close": "Closed"}}, "comments": ["YUM!

It is slit down the middle and grilled. SOOOOO good. Then after adding on ketchup, grilled onions, pickles ad relish, it was as good as it gets. I really dislike boiled hot dogs, so the grilled hot dog was just outstanding. Son also order the hot dog and hubby ordered the little cheeseburger. Their junior cheeseburger is so filling, I never order their full size cheeseburger. The Little fries fed all of us, with lots left over as the guys didn't eat that many. They were seasoned well and weren't limp or greasy. The Free-Style Coke machine (yeah, cherry vanilla or orange Coke) and free peanuts just made things even better while we waited for our food to be prepared.The staff at Five Guys is always so friendly, much more than other fast-casual-food chains and this location didn't disappoint in that respect. They always seem genuinely happy to be at their jobs, serving you. \u00a0I've not yet had a customer service person who was unfriendly, grouchy or completely bored out of their mind while they were serving me.

Also, the cajun fries are good but not salty or crispy enough. Would have loved to have more of a crunch to them. The soda machines, however, make up for it.

From the manager, (blond locs) very impersonal, rude, unconcerned, to the ladies taking the orders. I went there on a Tuesday, order was wrong, went back Wednesday for coworkers, order was incorrect once again... Shame on me for going back a third time, but I made sure that I called, expressed what was happening with my orders. I wanted a salmon wrap... No salmon, I wanted a jerk chicken wrap, not at this location, ok, how about some jerk wings, sorry but no wings!! just a mess. I asked to speak to the manager, I was told by Danielle that the manager does not take calls, and will not come to the phone. Really??? I was livid, had to drive back to complain about my order. I can't, I just can't, it's really ridiculous that such a beautiful establishment, has poor service, poor food, and no intent to improve.", "I've had bad experiences with these people in the past but was too tired and hungry to drive all the way from Bronzeville to my favorite, most consistent spot , JERK CHOICE.So I decide to come here. I live 3 minutes away, call in my order which they tell me will take 35 minutes. I give them 45 minutes and start on my way because I know how black folks can be. Wouldn't you know it I get there and my order isn't done. I waited another 15 maybe 20 minutes.Prior to trying this location I hadn't been brave enough to try them in years and after getting my food i recalled why. The chicken was good but after waiting an hour for it-it was cold and needed to be placed in the microwave. The cabbage was outstanding.....the rice. What the heck is up with this rice and peas???? Who told y'all that sweet rice and peas was the thing to do? Whatever you're doing to this rice, abort. This dish is meant to be savory not sweet. My meal could have been so good without this sweet rice and peas.", "Just started a new job and since I am training in the area, I decided to try out uncle joe's while attempting to find Harold's chicken shack. That elusively delicious fried chicken will be mine, but Uncle Joe's did a solid job filling in. This is a two level restaurant and for patrons confused as to why you can enter a restaurant that is completely empty and dark on the first floor, it is because you do your ordering on the second floor.Now, I was pretty excited to try the food out here even though the yelp reviews here are quite underwhelming. A few coworkers told me to try the jerk chicken, and jerk chicken lunch special I did. It was about a quarter chicken, rice peas, and a side for near $9. pretty pricey for the amount of food I got but it was really tasty stuff. However, I asked them for cabbage as a side and the menu advertised that the lunches come with plantains. Instead I received no plantains, and mac & cheese instead (I can't complain too much about this swap though lol). There was also a piece of white bread in my container with a corner missing; I wondered if someone took a bite out of it.Good food here but a few too many mishaps with my order to warrant a four star review. I could see how people gave them 1 or 2 stars. You probably just have to catch this place on a good day.", "Went back saturday to get my meal replaced the only good thing was danyell was pleasant very helpful and took care of me got home the chicken was worst than my order from wednsday it was flavorless my dog has a sensitive stomache he was able to eat it the rest i threw out uncle joes will not get another dime from me for a while if i wanted tasteless food i would go to any hospital and eat their food i just cant believe how bad the food and service is since i left in 12/2012 for now he has lost a loyal customer Pissed I don't know why I keep coming here it is a guilty pleasure again ordered a whole and a half barbecue i should have known better when they said they were out of chicken meaning they throw the seasoning on and put it on the grill got home chicken didn't have a ounce of taste to it this was Wednesday finally got a hold of someone Friday and told me to bring the food back and they would replace it i was ok with that because when their on its delicious when it's off it is horrible I keep saying I'm going to no longer go there give in and have a horrible experience i don't know what's going on but the service is horrible and being in this business u should make sure your customers r satisfied and don't just take their money and serve your customers anything I'm about to go up there and if I have to sit up there for hours this will get rectified will keep you posted", "I love Jamacian food and had a good time at this place about a month ago, but as of yesterday night June 25, 2015, I would not put any stars if I could. DO NOT EAT AT THIS RESTAURANT!As I ate my meal and had a conversation with my aunt i couldn't help but see a mouse. It came out into the floor...it was walking in an slow unusual way and then scurried back under a Booth. We lost our appetite and told the waiter. A Mouse!!!!! This means there are more because mice live in groups, which means they drop feces everywhere....So the manager comes out 30 minutes later and she told me...YES WE HAVE A MICE INFESTATION PROBLEM. We have had an exterminator come every Monday to deal with it.... OMG she is aware and still serving food and not closings the doors until it's under control. This is DISGUSTING, UNSANITARY, UNACCEPTABLE and putting people at RISK for ILLNESS.IF YOU CANNOT RUN A RESTAURANT UP TO CODE THEN YOU SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN.", "Food. OK! Definitely had better. Let's first start off by saying the place is beautiful. It's a two-level dine in restaurant and I only dine in uncle Joe's. Next, customer service I give it one star. I came in and the waitresses and the cashier was all sitting down gossiping about the cooks. I had a phone in order I called at 715 I got there at 7:40 they told me 30 minutes and I didn't leave until 8:10. 1 hour wait basically.Ok so I ordered a jerk dinner and a jerk shrimp dinner. The jerk shrimp were literally the size of the shrimp that in shrimp fried rice at the Chinese resturant seriously the jerk dinner I mean you can't really go wrong with that. I did call to complain about the super small shrimp and they tell me they are always size. So I pay 1699 + tax for 6 shrimps. \u00a0End of story if you want some jerk go to Hyde Park jerk Uncle Joe's way better food way better customer service", "Impromptu meet with friends for food and drinks.

Good prices. \u00a0I opted for my old stand-by favorite a Reuben sandwich. \u00a0They have two options, regular and \"New York\" style with double the meat. \u00a0I opted for regular and it was fine for me. \u00a0No leftovers. \u00a0I asked for a take out menu and the guy said they don't have one. \u00a0What restaurant doesn't have a take out menu? \u00a0Apparently this one! \u00a0 I'll be back anyway and maybe try something different next time.", "Bergstein's is a perfectly acceptable option near the UChicago campus on Hyde Park. It's more of a hike than one expects, coming from the Booth building on 58th, but so long as it's not iced over, the walk is safe and brisk.I've gotten the bagel and lox a couple times. Contrasting it to my preferred city bagel at NYC Deli, Bergstein's is a little saltier and definitely skimpier on the smoked salmon. It'll set you back a Hamilton (soon to be Tubman?), which is not cheap, but hey, it's Chicago.", "Good ingredients, fast, and lots of options. So far, I've tried the chicken philly (like a Philly cheesesteak but with chicken) and the Berger (two party burger with pastrami and 1000 island dressing). Both were solid, filling, and they have a great list of sides to choose from. Service is also good, and interior design is clean and comfortable. Will definitely be coming back.", "This is by far my favorite place to eat in Hyde Park - everything I have had is delicious! It's also the only place on the South Side to find kosher salami from Romanian! You can get it in a sandwich, or an entire salami - small or medium - in the casing to go. The lox and bagels (brought in from the North Side) there are delicious in the morning, as well as the black and white cookies with Intelligentsia coffee :) For lunch or dinner, definitely recommend the JP Meilach (I order without cheese), and the potato salad. Will hopefully try the knishes soon :)", "The sandwiches are very good and the service is friendly and quick. All of the sandwich elements are excellent. The meat is high quality and the breads are fresh and delicious. I had the potato salad as a side. It was good but didn't blow my mind and I would have liked a little larger portion. The pickle spear served with each sandwich is really good. I could probably eat a jar full no problem. Overall a really good experience that is way better than most of what Hyde Park has to offer.", "AmazingI had their chopped liver and it tasted just like my Grandma Sarah's!!I consider myself an expert on chopped liverAnd their whitefish salad is excellent.", "Ordered the Benson burst that's corned beef,pastrami Swiss on rye an a side of onion rings it was great", "I would give this spot five stars if it were not for the 9:00am open time and the relatively expensive prices. Delis are expensive, so I will give them that benefit of the doubt. But 9:00am? Opening at 8:00 would definitely allow them to steal some customers from the Starbucks a few doors down.Anyways, I actually really really like Bergstein's. This is the only place in Chicago that can properly make a bagel with lox and cream cheese. Their lox is outstanding and I am pretty sure that their bagels are from New York Bagel and Bialy up in Lincolnwood.I don't think I can afford to come here too often but I will try to be a once a week or once every other week customer because the product is definitely worthy.Keep up the good work", "Oh. Em. Jee. This place totally hits the spot. Amazing grilled cheese sandwich with potato salad and pickle for $5. Add a cup of matzoh ball soup for $4.50, and you have in every happy, totally stuffed customer. Plus the hubs loved his whitefish salad and bagel - better than NY delis, he says. Decor is basic fast food but big window views of Augustana Lutheran Church and gorgeous fall leaves make up for it. Highly, highly recommend.", "Bergstein's is among my favorite restaurants in Hyde Park. \u00a0The Reuben eggrolls are amazing and I haven't seen them anywhere else.I always bring the squad with me and the wait is never too long, and always worth the wait. \u00a0The all-day breakfast menu is killer, and would recommend the Big Egg. \u00a0Also they have a 10% student discount that runs all year, so definitely a plus.", "Loved my lunch! I got the second city sandwich, cold with lettuce, tomato, mustard and mayo. It was so good. You can have your sandwich hot or cold and it comes with a pickle and one side.

This place is good for grabbing a quick bite or eating out with friends.", "Absolutely LOVE this place! \u00a0I've tried pretty much everything on the menu and I've never been disappointed. \u00a0Plus, it's become my go-to for catering orders whenever we bring lunch into the office.", "Great lunch specials! $5 sandwiches with a side (with healthy alternatives to chips like grape cups).

This time I brought my girlfriend and we had the opportunity to talk to the owner Pam; she was so sweet and so excited about her business. \u00a0She spoke to us like we were VIP I mean straight celeb status. \u00a0What made me want to come back more than anything was her positive passion for her business and the food.She allowed us to taste the Alabama Bonfire Pulled Turkey for 7.99 and it is so worth it because she uses real turkey that is slowly smoked or roasted(IDK and I don't care which one it was all I know is it was soooooo good) \u00a0If you like Turkey I say TRY THIS!!! You won't be disappointed and the Alabama BBQ sauce is delicious. \u00a0Please note even if you like cheese don't mess up this fabulous treat with cheese Enjoy it as is!What can I say about the freshly ground BYOBB(BUILD YOUR OWN BURGER) made to order Sirloin Burger? \u00a0What can't I say? \u00a0I wasn't expecting the mound of tasty and flavorful beef to touch my tongue and marinate with my taste buds in such away that I savored each bite as I bit into my sandwich. \u00a0If you check out my pictures you will see why it's worth 7.99 and the add-ons are from .49 to .99 not a bad deal at all. \u00a0I added mushrooms, Bonfire Smoked Cheese and bacon(make sure you say you want your bacon crispy) I also added the marinated red onions for free.This is one of the reasons I like the Owner Pam so much because although the Turkey Burger was good it wasn't great. \u00a0The flavor on the turkey was on point but because they are made then frozen it took away from the amazing burger and when we told her our opinion she didn't give us an attitude she actually listened and took what we said as constructive criticism. For all my Turkey Burger Heads let Pam know you are willing to wait for a fresh burger with a great price and good flavor I know she will appreciate it.They use all fresh ingredients nothing canned...I think that's what set her apart from other places as well. \u00a0She runs or has a community garden where they get there fresh veggies for the salads.Don't worry if you are a Vegetarian or you know someone that is because they have a variety of fresh items for you as well like Grilled Portabella Sandwich, Tofu Wrap, Bonfire Veggie Burger, Tofu Omelet and Salads. A plus is the Vegetarian items are cooked on their %100 Vegetarian Only Grill!!!They also serve Maxwell Street Style Food, BBQ and soup.They no longer serve the turkey tips at this time but we can cross our fingers that they come back.We also tasted the Shaken Lemonade and Ice Tea very good and a large is only 1.89.She also thinking about having a soul food day on Saturdays...I hope she does because she was saying the green would come straight from the garden...Yum!You WON'T FIND any \u00a0fried chicken, fried catfish, mozzarella sticks, etc. it's all about the grill and freshness. \u00a0They do have French fries though...lolIf you can't tell I love the food and I think the owner is great and I think we need to support this place because the owner cares about her customer and has a passion for her food!!Give them a chance and don't forget too....Enjoy!!!!", "I finally decided to check out the restaurant since I heard they have pretty good food. If my food wasn't cold by the time it got to me, I could actually vouch for them in that department. I ordered my meal a little after 5pm. I check my email and the estimated delivery time was between 6:40-6:50pm. I was fine with that. Soon, I get an email stating that the delivery would arrive at 6:55. Again, it wasn't a big deal. I wait and the food didn't arrive yet. So I get in contact with the restaurant, I get another time change. This time it's 7:05, 7:05 comes, I get a another time for 7:14. That time comes by, it's 7:29. Once 7:29 pops up on my clock, next thing I know I get a message stating that they're on their way. My food didn't arrive until 8pm. Plus I told them to have the delivery driver text me when they got to my apartment...... He didn't even have the decency to come to the door! I had to walk out and find his van. To top it off, the restaurant knew that this guy in that green van took forever to drop off my food. It would've been nice to get a warm meal since I waited that long. Bonfire, my food was cold. I ended up throwing it away. Dude didn't even give me all of my change. You guys are tripping. If I could leave a review without that one star, I would.", "I returned and had BBQ tips and an horchata. The tips were tender with a slightly sweet sauce. Fries are included. They were good.

Great price and their veggie burgers and veggie philly are both amazing! It's definitely one of the cheaper places to order from, too. The only hang up is sometimes the paper bag smells like weed... Ha. I don't really mind too much, but it is kinda gross. Whatever the delivery guy does on his own time is fine with me, but the smell is kinda annoying. It's not enough to keep me from ordering though!", "If you like fresh ingredients you will love Bonfire Grill Chicago. Everything is made fresh. There are huge windows you can see your food being made while you wait which is always good.

It wasn't even a shawarma sandwich it was a sloppy chicken gyro with curry seasoning. I also order a hotdog Chicago style.

If you ever go, make sure you get the older White woman with the bleach blonde hair and glasses. She is a riot!!! We made jokes with her the entire time we were there. The dessert presentation is not that great and they didn't have every dessert listed (one of the reasons I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars). I had the double fudge cake and it tasted great.

Overall they never disappoint and provide decent portions at good prices.", "I ordered pancit for the first time today and it was horrible! The noodles were tatseless, the chicken tasted like it was a week old. I got it delivered to my place of employment. I called back and spoke with the owner PATTIE and voiced my concerns to get something else and she said I would have to repay the delivery charge..Now mind you, myself and the entire department orders from this place on a regular basis. I feel that a one-time courtesy could have been granted to have something else delivered. Obviously, this place does not care about customer service or satisfaction. As a result, they have lost my business as well as my department. Furthermore, there are many more restaurants in the area to order from so I will be utilizing my options.", "The food is of decent quality. I've been here multiple times and I can't really complain about the food. It's not amazing, but at the same time, it's not bad. I'd say this place is a bit expensive relative to the quality. But there is something that I really don't like about this restaurant: the service. On multiple occasions, I have seen the waiters/waitresses socialize with each other while my food was waiting on the kitchen shelf. One time, several minutes went by before the waitress delivered my food. Worse yet, during this time, she wasn't taking orders or delivering food - she was just chatting.", "My 3 stars is not a bad review at all. We went on a cool day (my husband was dressed very summery but it was actually cold) but when we went inside it was very cozy and we were welcomed with a huge smile and were seated by the kitchen which I actually liked. We were able to see all the dishes that were coming out. I did end up asking the waitress what dish did that table just get because it looked so yummy. My husband and I both ordered the drunken noodles. We ordered it extra extra spicy because we loves spicy food but it was not spicy at all. But that was ok. The dish was very very good. I love thai basil and this had tons of it. We also ordered the Vietnamese Spring Rolls. YUM YUM YUM! So good. My son ordered the egg rolls. Those were good. Nothing spectacular though. My son also ordered Beef Fried Rice. It was good as well. We couldn't forget to order our Thai Iced Tea. VERYYYY GOOD!All in all, service was EXCELLENT and our food was good.We would definitely go back in a couple of months. It is a bit of a drive.(I am craving it right now!)", "Is the staple off-campus dining hall for UChi students during academic year. Variety of options, all of which are satisfying both in terms of time, portion, quality, and cost. Also, since most dishes contain some sort of protein and veggies, assuming Noodles dishes are healthier than macNcheese / ramen noodles seven days a week. Having said that, the atmosphere and quality of food are akin to an off-campus dining hall. Satisfying, but nothing special, kind of like white rice.

I had lunch delivered through GrubHub and it was super fast. The chicken was moist, tender, and flavorful. I enjoyed the potatoes over the rice as my side. The vegetables were much better than last time, when I dined in they were soggy but today they were tender but firm. The red lentil soup was good, especially with a little swirl of the yogurt for some added tang. I wasn't really thrilled with any of the appetizers. The hummos was just alright, but they gave me tons of warm pita bread! Round two was much better than round one, but I'm still not super impressed.", "New location, new building, and new staffers - the Nile is no longer as homey as the one of my college days but the same server who used to staff the smaller storefront by herself is still here and the lentil soup is as smooth and flavorful as I like it.

This was a new dish for both of us and I was impressed by how evenly cooked the rice was while dotted with bits of tender lamb and vegetables.", "I loved the shawrma ... good place to eat and the everything is fine and good prices too... I would recommend Nile Restaurant for anyone love Arabic food :)", "I've had this a few times now delivered for different group and meeting functions and every time I've had it, I have left full and happy. The room always smells so good and the smell of falaffel wafting down the hall will make your whole building or floor hungry too which is always a good thing. That said, nothing is packed with a ton of flavor but they do bring you a large variety of food when ordering for a group. Their falaffel is probably the best thing they do here, and for that I will continue to order from them for sure. Their spicy chilli pepper paste is also a great topper for the falaffel and they bring you an obscene amount of pita bread for you to make your own pitas of fun. Their hummus and tahini are so so but their chicken shawarma is also pretty good and here is another order where they give you a ton of chicken. I wish they actually packed for falaffel balls into their large orders since I find our groups always end up with that awkward stare down over who will be the person to take the few falaffel or who would be the nice one to offer to split one with someone else...you know how those food wars go, and it is all for the falaffel here!", "I loved this place! Its got a moder decor, plenty of comfortable seating, a large menu, and friendly staff. My best friend was raving about this place so we had lunch here. It was nice as it wasnt too crowded. The menu offers lots of choices. If you are vegetarian, \u00a0don't you worry, they have choices for you too! The helpings were huge so I didn't mind the price being a little higher than expected. The staff were attentive, but not overwhelming. I look forward to coming back. PS: when they offer sides, PICK THE RICE!", "The Nile remains a good choice for lunch/dinner in Hyde Park if you're craving Mediterranean food. Don't expect anything groundbreaking, but it's cheap, consistently good, and a welcome addition in an area without many good options.I usually opt for the beef/lamb shwarma sandwich ($7), a warm pita stuffed with a very generous portion of thinly sliced, roasted beef and lamb along with some tomatoes, onion, and tahini. Simple yet filling and tasty - the chicken shwarma sandwich ($6) is also a great value.I've also tried the maklouba, which sounded different, not something you can find at your typical fast-casual Naf Naf/Roti/etc. in the Loop. It's a kind of rice casserole and the flavors were on point, lots of spices with a hint of sweetness. The yogurt paired really well with the eggplant and carrots, but the whole thing was pretty mushy and really needed some texture.The hummus is standard, nice and creamy but bland. The babaganouj is just slightly smoky and pretty good, and the stuffed grape leaves are small but pack a lot of flavor and a nice hint of lemon. Overall, the Nile is safe but solid Mediterranean fare and the decor is clean and lined with a lot of dark wood. I'll definitely grab a lamb shwarma sandwich to go every now and then.", "Tried their food for delivery once, had the three meat sample, which was a huge portion and very decent price. The meat sampler was okay, the meats were a bit dry even though I asked for medium but tasted pretty good, however the rice was below average. The salad and soup was not very below par, as it looked strange and tasted just as strange. I might try this place again, depending if there are no other grubhub options available.", "LOVED the hummus and pita bread. The hummus was simple but flavorful. The falafels were good and the sauce to dip them in made it even better.", "Love it. Great service, food is delicious, and everything is done in a timely fashion.", "This is probably one of my top ten restaurant choices. One item I always order is the Turkish Coffee. They put a little cardamon in the coffee to make it delicious. This last time I ate here I got a Palestinian dish, that to me seemed like home cooked food. It's a new item that I don't see on the online menu, MAQLOUBEH. It is a well rounded meal including rice, lamb or beef, eggplant, cauliflower and served with homemade yogurt. This place is kept neat and tidy and the service is very good.", "So yummy. They are quick and friendly. Bread is warm. Food is just tasty. I eat here at least once a week.Downsides are that it's a bit pricy (although my 1 meal always gives me another 2-4 of leftovers), and there is never any parking : (This 'new' location is crazy nicer than the old one when it was on east 55th. (Not that that one was bad... this one just has high ceilings, warm colors, way more seating)", "Value: 3Food: 3.5Service: 4Red lentil soup: very good. I really liked its simple richness; it does what its supposed to. The salmon kabob was surprisingly fresh, a 7/10, considering we're in Chicago. It wasn't seasoned, just lightly seared. The pinkness was darker than what fresh salmon looks like.Ordered the Shish Barrak, $17 however the beef was not in dumplings but rather boiled and very tender, came apart nicely with the fork.Over rice, the seasoning was subtle, the yogurt helped add some depth but the dish was definitely not worth that much.", "My friends and I went to this location for lunch. I ordered a Jerusalem salad, a middle Eastern coffee, and a chicken shawerma wrap for lunch. We also shared some falafel balls. The salad was delicious and plentiful, the coffee filled with cardamom, and the wrap was toasty. I really enjoyed the falafel and the salad, but in the end found the wrap a bit bland.

Great to get some work done.- Kid friendly, with a book shelf for reading in your down timeThe Bad:- non-dairy milks are all sweetened, which makes any fancy non-dairy latte TOO sweet after the flavouring is added.- a lot of the food is low quality pre-made mixes and packaged products (pancakes aren't fresh made batter, hummus is pre-packaged, the \"cheese\" is orange american style single slices, \u00a0breakfast condiments are just Smucker's jams and pancake syrupetc. Skip the food.)- blended cold drinks are made with a packet of pre-mixed artificially flavoured powders (YUCK.

I chalked this up to an \"oops\" and quickly grabbed the simple syrup bottle instead.So when Robust Coffee Lounge comes along and intentionally sells me a \"honey nut latte\", you've caught my attention. And I wasn't sure if it was in a good way, or a bad way.Short answer: in a good way. The honey and rich coffee work together really well, actually, with the flavors complementing each other and not conflicting. The \"nut\" part of the drink (probably almond syrup) was a nice touch, and I think that was what made the whole thing quite sweet. It's an excellent iced coffee, with a rich sweetness. And it was perfect for a post-run drink. It's a nice place to hang out in, to boot.

St. Beach).Ok, now I'm done with the review. \u00a0It's time for me to space out at RCL...", "I meet the owners when they were building this cafe. I knew then it would bring new life into a neighborhood with very few social spots to hand out. Robust is a great place to meet with friends and family or to do a quick meeting.

What a mistake! This spot has delicious food, plenty of seating, and fantastic music playing to liven up the atmosphere. This is a very sunny spot that is perfect for grabbing lunch with a friend or for studying. They have a great selection of sandwiches for lunch- I had the roast beef, which came on an onion roll and was very tasty! I can't wait to come back here again and try out the many yummy-looking pastries and cakes they have on display!", "I come here a LOT because of its proximity to my workplace--sometimes on the clock and sometimes not, depending. In the 25 or so times that I've been to Robust, I've tried a LOT of the menu and I have also had a lot of different interactions with different staff. I have not had a particularly consistent experience here, which is why I have held off on a review. I've had some five-star customer service experiences and some two-star customer dr vide experiences. I've had some five-star food and some two-star food. I'm going to focus instead on my overall experience, including the sum of 25 visits to Robust. Overall, Robust is an excellent addition to the Woodlawn community. It's located conveniently right on the corner and it's a meeting place for lifelong residents of the community, as well as University of Chicago staff and students who want to venture a little off the beaten path off campus. Uniform-clad school children can frequently be found here enjoying a snack or beverage after school hours. The diversity of customers at Robust is great and adds to the welcoming atmosphere.The service can be hit or miss. Some of the staff are incredibly kind, patient, and friendly, while others are fairly negligent and inattenive. My orders are messed up maybe 35% of the time, which is not the best. I have had my order forgotten more than a few times. Sometimes, the staff are really apologetic and offer to give me extra flavor or a bigger size to compensate. Sometimes, they barely bat an eyelash. I've tried maybe half of the menu items, including blended drinks like the oreo madness, smoothies like the almond milk, banana, chai, food items like the grilled cheese and hummus platter, the mocha diablo, pumpkin spice latte, gingerbread latte, etc. So, why the four-star rating? At the end of the day, I know I can count on Robust to be a cozy haven--a true gem in Woodlawn. Robust has a great atmosphere, acceptable drinks/food/prices, and (most importantly, for me) seating, outlets, and wifi. Seriously, I have never not been able to find a seat or outlet here and that is the most important thing! I will continue to be a happy customer at Robust as long as I work in Woodlawn.", "Hands down one of the best coffee shops in the city, right up there with Dollop. The coffee is great, the food smells delicious, though I've yet to taste any of the cuisine. The atmosphere is very trendy, but manages to still feel very south side. There are plenty of outlets and seats, although the few times I went, the available seating was limited to the area by the door, because the lounge area was pretty packed. \u00a0When I was growing up down the street, I would never have imagined a place this cool and diverse venturing outside of the Hyde Park/ U of C area, but I'm glad they did.", "This place beats the pants out of Starbucks. \u00a0Staff is very friendly and the decor is old school with industrial qualities. I would definitely suggest having a taste of the honey nut latte. This drink is an amazing warm, smooth, and just the right amount of love in a cup \u00a0to brighten any day.", "Nice little coffee spot but I wasn't a fan of the London Fog. Honestly just tasted like warm milk and tea... Their sandwiches look really great though.", "Looks like it could be a nice place but I wasn't pleased with the service....or lack thereof. We walked in to get drinks and ice cream and when I saw the menu I told my kids maybe we'd come in one day for breakfast. We stood at the counter and there was a girl making a drink. Her hair was awesome but she glanced at us and said nothing. We stood around. \u00a0A guy came from the back and made eye contact, but said nothing. We stood around. The girl came over and stood there silently. No, \"hello, may I help you?\" Nothing. My son wants to know if they have ice cream. \"Floats.\" He asks again. I try to explain that from her response I assume they only have vanilla ice cream and some sort of flavors of soda. She remains silent. He asks if they have cookies and cream. She shakes her head. Ok, he'll take a cookie. I ask what the shaken lemonade is. It's lemonade with flavors. Ok. We order a lemonade. \u00a0I ask how much the boxed water is (because it's fancy and people like to charge ridiculous prices for fancy stuff) She doesn't answer. Ok. \"So you want a cookie, a lemonade and a boxed water?\" No, I wanted to know how much the water is. $2. No thanks. She fresh squeezed (awesome!) the lemonade for my daughter and hands it to me. We walk out and my daughter spits the lemonade out. It's bitter. Unsweetened. Why not mention that? We go back in for sugar. \u00a0Maybe I asked too many questions. Maybe I wanted more because I'd just run 3 miles or maybe it was because I kept seeing this place and saying I was going to stop in. Whatever it was, I wasn't pleased with the service. \u00a0I've had a bad week dealing with UPS and Comcast, I want a smile and a hello at the local coffee shop, I guess.", "Great place for studying. Lots of room and everyone is super nice. Their mocha is amazing. Plus, the breakfast sandwich I ordered was made fresh. It was so good!

I can't wait to return!", "Nice place! Had the BBQ Betty. It was suppose to be on a pretzel bun, they were out of them so I was offered an onion roll. I must say it was tasty but every bite I wished I had that pretzel bun. \u00a0Also Got a piece of Carmel cake that was huge, tasted average and was $5, ugh. Seems like a great place to escape and get some work done, or \u00a0study. Nothing else really around it in walking distance.", "A very solid neighborhood coffee shop with friendly staff and tasty food. Good prices all the way around. I'm definitely sad that I don't live around the corner from them anymore. My only issue is that they are fairly slow with getting food out, which isn't great if you're on your way to work. They also don't use the highest quality ingredients in their breakfast items--very processed mixes, etc. But their sandwiches are great and reasonably priced.", "Everything here is good and made the way I like my food to taste!

This cafe is thankfully relatively not crowded and mostly devoid of students so it's a lovely escape from academia. It's a relatively small place but that adds to it's charm. Numerous tables near outlets and free wifi make this an excellent place to do work beyond the confines of a library. It's a lot quieter than a Starbucks, even with music playing, Their coffee is excellent and decently priced. But lemme tell you about their Rueben: A+.

I had their pizza for both lunch and dinner, two days in a row, and I never got tired of it. I know that sounds kind of like over-kill, but I do not know when I'm going to be back in Chicago, so I figured I should take advantage of it while I was there.", "Would not recommend. Food quality is not great (think frozen heat-up style), it takes forever to be served (if you don't call ahead, consider going somewhere else), and the chicken wings have feathers still attached to the meat.

Don't skip this just based off the name because they carry a variety of food stuff and not just pizzas. I personally love their Philly Chicken. The downside is the service/food preparation can sometimes be slow so make sure you call in ahead of time if you are doing a pick-up. Also during peak hours there is not enough room or tables to sit down and eat so you might have to resort to just doing a pick-up. Come down and say Hi to their friendly staff if you are down there for a Sox game, at IIT or in the Bronzeville/Bridgeport area.", "The only reason I am giving this restaurant a 3-star review is because of the staff. They tend to be really rude and sometimes will sit on the phone while they should be working talking to their friends.

A few months prior, I had ordered a calzone and was not particularly impressed. So, in the interest of seeing what else the Pockets menu had to offer, I decided on the aforementioned Asian pocket.We ordered out and upon opening the box, I discovered what looked like a mound of delicious vegetables with a sesame oil sauce on the side. The bounty of vegetables overflowing out of the barely visible pocket automatically won me over as a fan of this restaurant. The sauce was perfectly flavored- not too salty or heavy. I are most of the pocket with a fork! My only complaint was that the pocket itself was very bready and thick, especially at the edges. It's no wonder so much overflowed out of the pocket when it was not hollow enough to carry much in the first place. I can't wIt to order here again and to explore the menu some more! I know that the Asian pocket is abode sure home run!", "When I was a child, I stayed with my grandparents, who lived around the corner, frequently. Their favorite weekday lunch? The sandwich. \u00a0Mine? \u00a0Anything but.For my sweet Gram, a sandwich was composed of two slices of bread and even the most meager presence of a slice of Oscar Meyer meat and cheap American cheese, maybe a dab of light mayo and a little mustard. \u00a0It would be twenty years before I would actually learn to love a sandwich as my father-in-law, all of us fresh from a day at the lake, set out to make what I'll affectionately forever address as: The Most Wonderful Sandwich Of My Life. \u00a0A wheat hoagie bun could hardly contain the varied meats and cheeses, the mayo, seasonings, lettuce, tomato, something crunchy. \u00a0A potato chip? \u00a0And oh my God, I think I recall a piece of fruit. Was that a granny smith? \u00a0A halved grape?Pockets is not that sandwich. \u00a0But it is somewhere between the two I mentioned.When you order a pocket, it's going to come on some seriously dense bread, like a pita but with added density. \u00a0And it's going to be chock-full of lettuce and the varied toppings that comes on your particular choice, dressing on the side. \u00a0So full, in fact, that the toppings will be scattered all onto your plate (or take-out box). \u00a0I've never ordered Pockets and still felt hungry. \u00a0Not even a little. \u00a0And I almost always order their salads as the bread is just a little too much for me. \u00a0You still get a nice nob of it, though, wrapped up in foil, which smells amazing and tastes decently.The thing about Pockets that keeps it at A-OK rather seriously impressive is that, despite what you order (I'm talking only salads and sandwiches here), it's always going to be a one-dimensional experience, much like my grandparents' sandwiches. \u00a0You can have some varied toppings, dress it up a little, but there's really one unified taste going on, which is to its credit a nice, crisp, fresh one, but nothing overly impactful. \u00a0That's why, in odd form, I order a side of the chips to go along with my meal, simply to mix it up a little. \u00a0The one thing that I do really like about Pockets is that their dressings manage to save an otherwise bland meal into something with a bit of zing. \u00a0That, and ordering the salad rather than the bread saves the taste from being too carb-laden which tends to mask the punch the dressing packs. \u00a0For bold flavor, The Popeye and its complementary house dressing is the winner. \u00a0Asking for both bacon and chicken takes it up a notch as well. \u00a0Honorable mentions include The Original w/ Turkey (aptly named, a simple and classic taste) and The Waldorf w/ Turkey (very sweet, almost like a dessert salad).All in all, Pockets is an A-OK choice for those nights when you'd rather not spend your time in your own kitchen whipping up a meal instead. \u00a0Order the right thing the right way and you may even find yourself craving it from time to time. 3 stars.", "Their salads are a treat! I love the freshness of their ingredients & the homemade light ranch dressing is the bomb.com! The calzones are also great! Probably the only place you can get a good calzone in Hyde Park!

This particular restaurant needs major updates and a cleaning crew.We were the only two customers in there but the wait was amazingly long. The eating area was disgusting. All the tables were dirty and riddled with food. Paint on walls were chipping off (very visible to the naked eye). Beverage station was not only dirty but set so high that I couldn't see the top of my cup when trying to fill up with a drink. The iced tea station had the most horrendous smelling water. It was a combination of sewer water and wet mold. It was so gross. The employee allowed us to get bottled drinks after taking a whiff of that. There is mismatched artwork hanging on walls. Some have prices next to them. Does that mean they were for sale?On to the food....not too many complaints here except that they got my order wrong.

Keep up the good work yall.", "Some of the best bbq in the city hands down, but I would love to see some brisket and pork but...", "Even though I live on the North Side, I'm a South Side boy at heart. \u00a0I grew up coming here and, over the years, have converted several lovers and friends. \u00a0In the hearts and minds of many South Side Chicagoans, Lem's isn't just a restaurant; it's an iconic culinary institution. \u00a0So it goes without saying that every now and then, we get a taste for Lem's and before we know it, we're in the car headed South to 75th. \u00a0Tip 1: \u00a0know what you want when you step in the door, or prepare to make instant decisions when called upon. \u00a0Many an uninitiated individual has incurred the wrath of the spectacled woman that runs the show, takes orders, and doles out the chow. \u00a0Just like Teddy Pendergrass'll holler at you, this woman will too, and I've seen it. \u00a0I typically go for the Rib Tips (cut small, $.50 extra) and Link combo or the Center Cut Ribs, both with hot and mild sauce, which tends towards the vinegary side of the BBQ sauce flavor scale. \u00a0Fries and bread accompany, and part of the magic that is Lem's is having the sauce soak both the bread and fries, so that all may be consumed indiscriminately. \u00a0With this tip, I'll also state that, in both cold and warm weather, lines can be lengthy, so if you're close enough to see the menu board, you're close enough to make executive decisions.Tip 2: \u00a0Cash only. \u00a0From the looks of the place, the savvy individual can easily determine that a credit card machine is as welcome here as a new car is among the Amish. \u00a0Don't behave in the manner of the uninitiated and stand, mouth agape with credit card in hand at the register. \u00a0Just imagine the sassy, spectacled woman's reaction to this error, and remember your mother's gentle childhood scoldings, urging you to \"make better choices.\" Bring cash with you or be prepared to hit the Chase ATM in the Walgreens at 75th and the Ryan.Tip 3: \u00a0Resist all temptation to consume any of this in your car on the way home. \u00a0I've tried, with varying levels of success - sometimes on the expressway while piloting a vehicle - and have ruined several articles of clothing for my efforts. \u00a0Wait until you can get it home, throw down some newspaper, and decend into beast mode.Tip 4: \u00a0After you eat: \u00a0return and repeat. \u00a0The food is good, the prices are reasonable ($14-22 for rib/rib tip/chicken/hot link combos), and if you're a North Sider like me, it's a great excuse to take a ride and see an area of the city most only read about in the paper for its ills. \u00a0Expand both your mind and your waistline!", "Went this past \u00a0Sunday before NBA finals got in and out quickly. I've patronized Lem's my entire life and it didn't disappoint probably top 5-7 out of all my visits over last 35 plus years.

A must try if you haven't already it's worth it.", "If I could give a negative star I would.I had never had Lem's before, but after hearing such amazing things about it my husband and I decided to try it. Worst mistake ever. The rib tips were burnt and tough. The hot link was under cooked. The chicken was disgusting and the \"mild sauce\" was unlike anything I have ever tasted (and not in a good way). We wasted $27.00 today to learn a valuable lesson....never ever again.", "I went here on a whim late Friday night. Apparently this place has some amazing bbq. To be honest, I'd never heard of this place though I'm a resident and consider myself to be familiar with Southside spots.When I got to Lem's the place was packed! The tiny parking lot was full of cars and there were also cars lining the street. Inside is very small and there's nowhere to sit. There was a 30 minute wait for rib tips but it turned out to only be 20 minutes. Needless to say, it was worth the wait. The ribs were perfect, not too tough, very flavorful and not drowning in bbq sauce. I was so impressed with the food that I didn't care about the location, or the wait. Will def be back.", "The bucket of tipsare delicious.Especially with lemon and pepper sauce.You all should try it.It is very convenient.", "Yesterday went to what was my Favorite BBG house, Lems. What a disappointment! The rib tips were too salty and the entire order was full of burnt meat. I guess I will have to drive to I-57 for good ribs. I must say that Lems sauce is still the best. Flavorful with just enough kick. I guess that you can buy a gallon of sauce and put it on I-57 ribs!", "Wow. Ok, just... Lem's how DARE you serve me so much delicious meat! I can't believe I ate the whole thing. Large tips, mild sauce, the epitome of Chicago cuisine. This BBQ is indescribable. I'll let others try. I'm still stammering. The service was also impressive!

It was my wife and two sons (3 and 1). So, it started that there were no booster seats for the chairs - not a good start, but that is the ONLY bad thing I can say about the experience. Let's start with our server Jerome. He was professional, nice, accommodating, made relevant and GOOD recommendations and moreover was attentive - ask for him when you go. We started off with Jerome's recommended Peach's coffee. My wife got the Gouda and spinach omelette which I would like to say was delicious but she inhaled it without even offering up a bite!I got the shrimp and grits, cheese grits that is. At first I was disappointed because even though the shrimp were big there was only three, but as I dug in there were two more large ones under the blanket of grits. Everything was in perfect balance, the cheesey grits, the large shrimps, the chunks of bacon. Three words: de lish ous!!!This is a great brunch spot, with great service and great food. I highly recommend you try it out and then, try it out again. See you there, Sunday, after church!", "Finally made it to Peach's. \u00a0Walked in and it was a pretty long wait (25-30 mins) but with my desire to want to try this place out AND starvation from skipping breakfast, I decided to just buckle up and wait it out and see what's the hype about.And it was about nothing! First, when you have a long line of people waiting to sit down, it's probably a good idea to clean the tables to accommodate those waiting to sit down. \u00a0This wasn't the case. \u00a0We sat and watched tables go 5-6 minutes with empty plates and trash from the people who previously sat there. \u00a0It may seem picky but there were more than enough staff walking around that someone could've cleaned up an area and allowed to others to eat and keep the line moving. \u00a0We finally got a seat and menu and the selections looked pretty impressive. \u00a0Our waitress was attentive, professional and knew the menu and gave us a good breakdown of the choices. \u00a0One positive is substituting foods. \u00a0Almost every entree you can choose from 5-6 different things to substitute as sides. \u00a0I ordered the Philly Omelette and it was overcooked. \u00a0And little bit of salsa they give you doesn't help it all. \u00a0 The upside is I chose the waffle as a side and that was pretty good. \u00a0As was the house potatoes that came with it. \u00a0But the side order of chicken wings we received were severely overcooked. \u00a0 And my guest ordered shrimp and grits and the grits looked like a soup and only had a few shrimp in them. \u00a0 Wasn't impressed with the food at all.Price wise I thought it was pretty fair. \u00a0It's a pretty decent portion size and if the food was cooked better, it would've been well worth. \u00a0Place is a little small but with a few touches here and there, it could be much better.", "Since there are no real family restaurants or sit down spots in Bronzeville, I was EXTREMELY excited for Peach's to open up. No words to describe my excitement. And because I am a mild H-Dog fan, I just KNEW Chef Rome wouldn't disappoint. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Because I try not to give up so easily on Black business, I went here on 3 different occasions. They EACH left MUCH to be desired. 1) The prices are too high. And for prices you pay, the portions are very underwhelming. Very. My \"grits\" were disgusting. Maybe it was some sort of grits soup that my uncultured ass just doesn't know about, but... No. Wasn't feeling them. The pancakes were not done in the middle. And the bacon was cold and unimpressive. When I told the manager, he was very nonchalant about it. 2) I'm a coffee drinker and if for no other reason, I would visit for the peach coffee. Absolutely amazing. I love it. 3) I had a server named Talilah who was SO awesome that it was a mild distraction from the unimpressive menu. I requested her the times I returned. There was another woman hosting who was amazing as well. Don't know her name though. All that to say... Customer service here (from the staff) is actually awesome. Overall, it's nothing to get excited about. If you live or work in the area, it's a cool lil spot to meet up for Saturday morning coffee or whatever, but other than that? Nah, bruh. Don't go in here starving expecting to leave satisfied. If imma leave broke, I don't wanna leave hungry. If imma leave hungry, I don't wanna leave broke. I left both. Lol! One star for customer service. One star for the amazing coffee.", "The space is large and airy with simplistic but homey decor. The wait was pleasant enough (five minutes longer than expected but short considering they were busy). We noticed right away that the employees were scattered, doing multiple tasks. For example, the hostess was seating guests, taking to-go orders, answering the phones, in the kitchen preparing to-go orders, cleaning tables, and mopping. The waiters and waitresses were also seen doing several jobs. They also were waiting on tables across the entire restaurant instead of a designated section which made them scattered. Our waiter was pleasant but not as attentive as we would've liked. When the food came out SEVERAL items were missing and when we inquired he asked us what was missing. If you see two omlettes that you know come with some form of bread, how does the waiter not recognize that those otems are missing? The food *sigh* it was just OK. Between three people we had the lamb omlette, spinach omlette, pancakes, peach bourbon french toast, duck bacon, potatoes, and grits. The omlettes were bland and overcooked. The pancakes weren't fluffy and reminded me of frozen ones. The other items were not bad but just ok. Not sure if I will return. I MAY try one more time. I would give them 2.5 stars if I could.", "Wow!This was such a let down. The environment & the staff appeared open & friendly. The food itself was a disaster. The salmon, bacon, & pancakes were all sent back b/c they were served to our table undercooked. The pancakes literally had wet dough in the center. The pork bacon was still pink as was the salmon. The food was sent back initially for being cold not room temperature but literally cold. Like how long was this sitting on a table with no heat light cold. When all of the food was placed on our table we knew exactly why it had taken so long to get our food! We had 1 order for the shrimp & grits which was piping hot (obviously was just cooked) but everything else was cold. SMHThere was a numerous amount of apologies but I'm sorry there is no excuse for a restaurant to send out cold food then replace it with undercooked food.", "The food was good. It was my first time trying duck bacon. I think more options on the menu would be good. The service was good as well. The prices are reasonable. All together, I spent under 20 bucks. Con: Their signature drink (peach tea) is served in a small cup and you have to pay full price for a refill.", "Very nice place,shrimp and grits was delicious and signature peach coffee would definitely recommend this. Wait staff very good and attentive. Clean restrooms.", "BLACK OWNED BUSINESS I love the decor and had heard great things about this restaurant. \u00a0Sadly my Catfish Poboy disappointed me.It was kinda fishy and dry. For $8 I expected a better sandwich and it only came with chips.My friend had the Philly Omelette which was good. I'll give them another try and order that next time.", "The 2 stars are for the grits. The service was so bad, I'll probably never return. After waiting close to 40-45minutes for three meals, my duck bowl was prepared with a big piece of plastic cooked in it. I ordered my egg over easy and my daughter ordered over medium but they both came well done with the entire yoked cooked. We waited 20 minutes for lemons for our water and had to ask for flatware and napkins once we were finally served. Our server didn't check on us at all, the runner had to correct everything that was wrong with our order so I left my tip for him. When the bill came we were charged full price for everything. Go figure! The cheese grits were great and the duck bacon was good.", "So, I LOVE THIS PLACE! Whenever I am in Chicago, I have to go to Peach's. I just have to. Everything about this restaurant is great to me. The food is delicious, the people are great, and the prices are even better. My first time visiting I ordered the egg and bacon sandwich with potatoes. My friend ordered the catfish, grits, and greens; I regretted my decision once I tasted his food. Don't get me wrong, my sandwich was delicious and just what I wanted, but everything about his food was mouth-watering. The grits were cheesy and smooth, while the greens were super flavorful. So good!", "First time there, was told it would be 5 mins to be seated at a table. 20 mins later, they offered us a spot at the lunch bar. 15 more mins just for our order to be taken, another 20-25 until food was delivered to us. 10-15 waiting for the check, 5 for our change lol all for mediocre food \u00a0everything was just ok, not enthused on returning anytime soon.", "It was a good wholesome breakfast. \u00a0The customer service and peach coffee was good.

Forward-thinking soul food, and even the veggie sides are great -- especially the greens and cheese grits.", "The photo speaks for itself. Bad choice for an enjoyable breakfast.", "My cousin and I got to try the 7up pancakes and I gotta say that although I couldn' taste the 7up as much as I hoped...the cream cheese glaze that they gave on the side really sealed the deal.The food was on par with what you would expect of a good diner. And everyone gave service with a warm smile...who woulda thought Chicago would be so cozy in the winter time? :)", "Went to Peach's yesterday for the first time and had the cheddar grits and croquettes.

I had heard great things about Peaches, but it took an out of town guest to visit. We ate there twice this weekend and enjoyed every bite. Pancakes were fluffy and moist. Shrimp and cheese grits was extremely tasty! Catfish, greens, & grits were yummy! Peach bourbon French toast were also amazing. I will be back!", "A neighborhood delight I was here on Saturday and enjoyed the chicken philly omelette which was very good. The potatoes were excellent seasoned and cooked to perfection.

Those biscuits are the size of a grown man's fists and are not to be eaten by the weak.4) Everything was just delicious. And being around so many brown and black people who just wanted to share in joy and love of food was everything a girl could ask for on a cloudy Sunday afternoon. 5) While the decor seemed to be a place of \"oh my gawd this isn't inviting at all\", I can say that it's about the feeling of a restaurant when you walk in that is the appeal. You had church folk, friends, lovers, families that came and just wanted to enjoy each others' company.

Worse when the delivery driver asked if I want to cancel my order I said no & that I want it delivered (brought up like the other 5 times) & he was rather rude & basically told me I want to cancel it then.Of course all the extra time is contributing my food getting colder, warming back or not, as well as impacting my schedule as I ordered it to be delivered at a specific time (later then when I placed the order).2) when I called & ASKED to speak with the manager the woman who answered gave the phone to a non manager that AFTER I explained the entire situation & I asked for the number for the regional corporate offices put me on hold & later another man identifying himself as the manager picked up the phone & I had to begin all over again.3) the replacement delivery driver was going to get a tip, & I tip well, but just had to open his mouth & chastise me about why the other driver had an issue!

After placing an order for an extra large pizza, some bites, a pop, and a few sides for dipping, we were quoted only 30 minutes for delivery. Great! The deliver driver called to announce their arrival and has us come outside. Somehow they only had our pizza and the wrong pop. The driver said they thought the pop was wrong, and realized that something was missing when looking at the $40 receipt. We told them the correct beverage and that we'd also ordered bites. We were made to sign the receipt, and the driver said they'd be right back with the rest of our order. Since they failed to mention the sauce, I called back and reminded them of those as well.The driver returned 10 minutes later and alerted us that he was here by honking. Out we go to grab the rest of our food. Nothing was cold, luckily. When we come back in to eat our pizza, we're missing a topping but we just left it be after all of that.

He took my credit card with him \u00a0just a precaution, but even then they wouldn't give him the order. Because I was unable to pick up the order myself, I called to speak to a manager. A male employee answered and said that a manager wasn't in, and wouldn't be available until tomorrow morning. I explained to him that I had placed an order online and that my fiance was in the restaurant attempting to pick it up, but denied. He said that it was a security issue and that the card holder had to be present. I explained to him that there was no message on the checkout menu that specified that the cardholder had to be present at the time of pickup. He said well you can call the number on the website. If customer security was such an issue, why isn't there a message specifying that guests must be present at the pickup counter if using a card?

I like HP, I do, but in my experience almost every chain restaurant or store (CVS on 53rd, I'm looking at you) is completely subpar. Domino's is the perfect example.

Yes, maybe I will start taking my own advice. :-)", "Crap service. Ordered a vegetarian pizza but found meat in it. Called to complain to the manager. No apologies at all!

The time I ordered my food was 8:58p, but it wasn't ready until 9:42p. A Jerk Chicken Dinner is what I got; nothing fancy or extraordinary. I've been here before, and when I ordered a jerk salad the previous visit, it was completely covered in cheese! The courtesy is to ask if cheese is a yay or nay, but I was able to push a bunch of the cheese aside to get through the salad. This time around, the customer service was at an all-time low. The cook was so slow, a woman that called in her order came in to pick up, and still waited about 30 minutes. I waited almost 45 full minutes for something that should be pretty efficient to prepare. I ordered a \"SIDE\" of yams and cabbage, and to my surprise, the dinner did not come with beans and rice, so my chicken was placed on a massive bedding of yams that were very unappealing. The jerk sauce is absolute rubbish; the worst jerk sauce I've ever had. It was diluted and had no kick whatever. The amount of chicken was also very modest compared to most jerk dinners, and was the only eatable portion of the meal (and the bread). There was a surge of people that all entered the restaurant at once, just have a few customers banging on the plexiglass for the cashier because she would disappear periodically. Oh...I can't forget the endless paper, debris, and flyers on the floor as 'decoration'.My first instinct was to turn away and go to Royal Caribbean on 71st, which always has quality/authentic jerk dinners. I was closer to this restaurant, but a valuable lesson is to always trust your 1st mind, and never let distance get in the way of quality. I learned the hard way.

Now that I've finally eaten there I'd say it was worth the wait.My mom happened to be visiting me so I sent her to Honey 1 for us. She ordered the rib tip/hot link combo while I opted for the smaller order of the hot link sandwich. My mom said she told the gentleman that she wanted the food mild but I'm not sure that's what we got as it was VERY hot. I'm talking nose running, eyes running, guzzling down water hot. IF that's Honey 1s version of 'mild' then I shutter to even imagine what the actual 'hot' version tastes like. My mom thought her food was entirely too hot and didn't enjoy it as much as she might have had it not too be spicy. First impression, the portion I got of links and fries was small. Just one link and a very small amount of fries. I didn't see the receipt but I'm guessing I got the lunch portion of the link sandwich. The order was small but very filling. I wasn't hungry after I hate it and didn't wish I'd ordered more food. I still think they are a bit stingy on the fries though. The other thing I didn't like was that the fries were separated from the links and bbq sauce. And there wasn't enough bbq sauce to coat or dip the fries in so I had to use ketchup. I like ketchup but eating it when the fries should be smothered in bbq sauce is sinful. I saw on the menu that you have to pay extra for additional bbq sauce. That will be a must the next time around. Overall though the food was good. I enjoyed it and would definitely go back and recommend it.My mom agreed even though the food was a bit too spicy for her. Since she ordered the combo she got a much larger portion than I did and had enough leftovers to save for the next day. She liked the link as well but said she wasn't blown away by it. She said the rib tips were much better but would have like a larger portion of fries as well. There was much more bbq sauce on her order than mine. Her meal also came with two pieces of white bread.The bill came to about $15 for the two orders.

Yes, definitely, and I can assure you I've been to most of them!

(And now I live in Rochester, NY, where nothing even comes close to what you can get here. Woe is my sushi life.)It's a really great place to catch up with friends. We used to go for lunch AYCE ($15, compared to $21 at dinner), and just chat for hours over sushi. My favorite rolls are the Spicy Scallop and the Chicago. Their spicy tuna used to be good (like 5 years ago), but now they use the really gunky tuna bits, so I don't order it anymore. They do the same with the center of the Salmon Lover's Roll unfortunately. Bubble tea is on the sweet side. Don't order the pinku miruku out of curiosity... it's pretty terrible.

They have vastly improved their ramen so much that I crave it now more than anything! I typically get the tonkotsu ramen and it has been delicious every time. Tip: you can substitute the pork in the tonkotsu with shrimp tempura and you will get 4 pieces of shrimp-- double what you get when you pay the $1.50 extra to add tempura.

Nigiri come with way too much rice and mediocre fish.Gyoza and shumai tasted like they came out of a frozen food bag.

The eggs were also soft, with just a little cheese scrambled in. Not gooey with cheese as one would expect.

Since 1973, when Spiros Argiris and Gus Sellis took over ownership, Valois continues to thrive and provide a great value for the price. \u00a0My personal favorites are the feta omelette with hash browns, turkey sausage, and coffee, as well as the baked chicken, mashed potatoes, corn, and coffee.

The price can't be beat and it's a great place for a group. The line can be long, but it moves pretty quickly. Getting your food is kind of like being in a standard cafeteria- trays, then napkins, then slide down to order. You should definitely know what you want when you get your tray though- there is no patience from anyone (customers or servers) if you don't!My personal favorite is coffee and the breakfast sandwich with eggs, sausage, and cheese, but I always find myself eyeing the pastry case at the end of the line.

But yes, it's the place you'll go every weekend with your friends to hang out, drink pitchers of beer, get served by bartenders who know you, and to feel at home and happy. God, I love Jimmy's.", "For what it is, it's an okay bar. I'm sure they are still in business due to the discernable lack of any bars or pubs in the Hyde park area. Beer selection is okay. They have Newcastle on draft, so that's a plus in my book. My advice to anyone who comes in...make sure you eat somewhere else first. The burgers taste like they are microwaved and served on Styrofoam plates. Like a picnic at grandma's house back in 1984. It's unfortunate because many \"dive bars\" are turning into amazing gastropubs. You just need a convection oven and an imagination.Also...it's cash only. Which I kind of get; the fees being crazy high. But for all that is good and holy, it's 2015 and I particularly don't want to carry cash in Hyde park after dark. They do have an ATM on site...yes, there are fees.", "Went in ordered a Corona and gave the guy five.

This is a dive bar, but it is also a great place to have a conversation or be left alone with your thoughts. Nestled near the University of Chicago and a short walk to Harper Court this is a great place to walk to and have a cheap meal and some good drinks.", "The Woodlawn Tap, or Jimmy's, is fine. The drinks are cheapish, there isn't great selection, and the atmosphere is kind of dark and uninspired feeling. Most of the patrons are from the University of Chicago nearby, which can be good or bad.There are three other bars in Hyde Park, and honestly I don't personally feel like Jimmy's fills a niche that the others don't already have covered. It's got a bit of neighborhood lore, but eh, this is Hyde Park, what place doesn't. If anything this is the place you should go with a slightly smaller group, if you aren't affiliated with UofC (if you are just go to the Pub). I guess it serves food -- so if you don't want to bring your own, there's a plus.", "\"Jimmy's\" is the quintessential dive bar. \u00a0Need to dig that kinda vibe to enjoy it. \u00a0Also great ham sandwiches and fries.", "A standard bar with decently priced drinks. The crowd is a bit louder during the day and younger during the night. Typical bar good morning extraordinary. The customer is fast and friendly. The interiors are rustic and cow boy themed. Good place to hang out with friends for some drinks in Hyde Park.", "It's an okay bar that plays its role well. A handful of okay beers on tap, cash-only (weh), TVs usually on a sports game and plenty of room to hang out with friends. This has usually been an 'end-of-the-night' type of place for me so far. It won't blow you away about anything, but it's a good neighborhood haunt and the staff are always friendly.", "Nice dive college type bar. If you're looking for something cheaper than this is the place. Cheap $7 pitchers, and tasty swiss burgers and grilled swiss cheeses.You can get a pint, swiss burger, and fries all for about $10", "Just fell in love with this place for its simplicity and its large beer collection. Cash only! Tip well.", "I've been going here for years, yes when we called it Woodlawn Tap. I go mainly for a quick delicious cornbeef on rye & fries. Yes, the music is questionable at times but stop whining and play something different or offer a win-win solution! It's a great neighborhood go to place.", "Pretty cool dive bar. Food doesn't really strike me as anything I would enjoy but their liquor selection and prices are great. Perfect spot for drinks and conversation, not too loud, practical layout, and good location. I will be back.", "Jimmy's is forever the place to be in Hyde Park and it has a great and cheap selection of alcohol. It takes cash only but they have some great eats too to go with those drinks. You can get a burger for $3 and a large plate of fries for $4.5. It is all U.Chicago students and it holds a special place in all of our hearts. A great dive bar and worth a visit. They even have lunch specials during the day!", "Woodlawn Tap is a great \"no frills\" dive bar. Our family of 4 stopped by for lunch and it was pretty empty, but the setup is nice and spacious. The decor is simple and \"worn\", but I think that's the look they're going for. The staff was really friendly and accommodating for our 2 little boys. They ordered sprites and the bartender added a splash of grenadine and cherries which they loved. The food was decent.....typical bar food. One large order if french fries was more than enough for our family. I wasn't too thrilled with the cheeseburger, because it's pretty small and the beef isn't high quality, BUT Woodlawn isn't trying to be a \"gourmet\" burger joint either, so I can't complain. My husband had a tuna melt and he said that it was very good. Our boys had grilled cheeses, which looked good and they gobbled them up. The prices are fantastic, so I can see why U of C students would frequent this place.", "Asked for two beers and a vodka soda, got served two beers and a soda. Had to pay for another vodka that should've been in there to begin with. Both bartenders were rude and put our money for the drinks in the tip jar and not the cash register.", "A staple for any UChicago student. A poorly lit bar with three separate rooms for you to find a table at. Stays open until 2AM. Beer and mixed drinks are pretty cheap (~4-5 bucks for a pint or well drink). Keep in mind that it is cash only.", "Everything you need in a neighborhood bar. Cheap high lifes, cheap dogs, Bulls were on and there were friendly people everywhere.", "And then, it came to pass that the Woodlawn made my Reuben sandwich list. What a sandwich, for only $4.50! Super value! A good size, plenty of corned beef. The ratio of sauerkraut to beef is excellent. Could have had a touch more dressing, but that's a fine point - I like Reubens moist and SOUR. Buttery rye bread, and served very hot. Perfectly paired with a cold Schlitz. Delicious.I pop in here about every two weeks before radio. The remodel was a big success - it's much brighter and open, without losing the appealing urban grit. Same friendly bartenders. Same chill, academic vibe.", "I like Jimmy's alright, because the prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is nice. But honestly, I will always opt for The Pub in Ida.

Judging from the outside, and walking location, we came here after our museum trip!This is a plant based restaurant. Threw me off guard. Start off with the customer service, was great. Huge on me* they nailed it. Place was tidy. Good amount of people on a Sunday. I ordered \"the soul bowl\" - they have wraps, bowls, meatless burgers, etc.Great to take your kid, especially if they are plant based. I really enjoyed the drink selection! Which had all sorts of homemade from Lavender Lemonade (Yum!) to a fresh pressed watermelon drink... Some organic options like green tea w/ citrus fruits... Mmmm!THE SOUL BOWL had carrots, zucchini, brocolli, kale...lots of kale, rice, \"chicken\" which is fried, you have an option of grilled... Next time, I'll get grilled. Sauce of ranch and bbq. I'd get more on the side cuz the kale really soAks this stuff up. It was good. It was plant bAsed... It was different. Had more of an earthy, smoky taste.My 2 year old picky eater even decided to gobble some of the veggies... Score! I also tried the fries, wasn't so fond. Big fry eater, but they tasted \"off\"Would like to explore more options here... Plant based can leave me a little hungry later during the night... Wish the bowl was like $8. Prices could decrease by a dollar or 2!", "I've had Native foods before and they always exceed my expectations. The food is always delicious, staff is friendly.

This was only my second time at this location (came right after the grand opening and the food was great; even if the service is SUPER slow; but counter staff is \u00a0friendly, so I'll give THAT a pass). Nice day, had a day off so decided to treat myself to lunch. BIG mistake; still the same PAINFULLY slow service. I walked in and why did I have to wait 10 minutes to give my order at the counter? In defense of the poor employee (who was pleasant and friendly), she seemed to be the only person working both register and bringing out orders to tables. \u00a0Note to management; even if it is 1:45pm it's still technically lunch hour, staff your restaurant accordingly. Waited another 10 minutes for my take out; when it came had to send back my sweet potato fries (they were cold; and WHY did the cook look mildly irritated when the manager told him to give me another order?). Should have checked my Chicken, Bacon and Avocado sandwich (which was also cold). Chicken and avocado were tiny, more greens on the bun than anything to compensate. The so called bacon was rubbery and little or no condiments on the bun. All this for a sandwich costing $10.29. Lesson learned; will NOT be going back to this location; the next time I eat locally going next door to Ja Grill; at least you get what you pay for there and at cheaper prices.", "Definitely will not be returning. On my one visit with a small group, we had to wait ~20 minutes to even place our order, the system is very inefficient. I chose the \"bacon cheeseburger\" - ok, I admit it, my mistake for not ordering well. But they messed up one of my friends' orders, and the rest of us waited another 10 minutes for them to correct it, as our food slowly got cold.The burger was pretty terrible and completely lacking in flavor. The seitan was just texture, zero flavor, there was only a tiny squirt of BBQ/ranch, and the pickle chips were soggy and tasteless. The caramelized onions in the burger were the best part of this meal, though I guess that isn't saying a lot.", "I'm not a vegan-fan but this place was really interesting.

My nieces ordered the gluten free mac n cheese (made with quinoa pasta) and cheesy quesadilla (with wheat tortilla). The kids couldn't tell a difference!The sweet potato fries were light and crispy. I ordered an oklahoma cheeseburger made with seitan. I would have to say - it was mighty tasty considering there was no real ''meat'' inside. The watermelon fresca is to die for. It's a perfect drink on a hot summer day in Chicago. Plus free refills!! It's sweetened with Organic Agave. I love any place that focuses on organic and healthy foods. Will be back again when I visit Chicago.", "Wonderful customer service from the manager. I wasn't able to give the avocado on my Azteca salad (which was delicious) to my 8 month old because of the seasoning.

Super healthy! Food tastes amazingly delicious and drinks are refreshing!", "Sorry native foods, but an avocado in a bun is not considered to be a sandwich. Where is the dressing and the seasoning?! If I wanted an avocado in plain bread, I would \u00a0have spent 3 bucks at the grocery store and made it myself. I was sorely disappointed by the food here. We also ordered the buffalo wrap and it was honestly to God just fried chicken breast smothered in this super unnatural looking red buffalo sauce. It was some of the grossest and unappetizing food I have had in Hyde Park. We were better off just going to the chipotle that was next door to native foods and buying four burritos for the price that we paid for the sandwich and wrap.

I cannot wait to try everything on the menu....and the service is excellent, my new favorite spot.", "Wonderful! I went for their soft opening an the service and food were both impeccable. We got the nachos, Saigon roll, and chicken buffalo wings or starters. The Saigon roll was so delicious and the peanut dip was beyond amazing. I would order that again.I also recommend the peanut butter parfait and watermelon fresca!It's a great addition to 53rd street and the staff was overwhelmingly nice and friendly.

Don't let the name of the soul bowl trick you, it didn't have a whole lot of soul, and was the blandest thing we ordered. However, the ingredients were fresh.

I pulled in and no one answered so I thought the speaker was not working so I waited my turn and got to the window to order and was told I would have to pull back around and order at the speaker, The wait was worth it , The burger was good and the fries were as greasy as I remembered them to be,", "When was the last time fast food was an 'experience'? \u00a0I'll be honest, I usually don't make it past 24th Street for anything so getting here is a bit of a pain.

If I get #1, I show him the package of white socks that I have already prepared in advance of my trip, thus saving me from buying more white socks.
